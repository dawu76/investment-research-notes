### AQR: Adjusting your portfolio to handle macroeconomic uncertainty

AQR's [Certainly Uncertain](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/White-Papers/Certainly-Uncertain): Macroeconomic uncertainty is likely to remain elevated due to a variety of factors. Investors should consider protecting their portfolio from a less certain range of economic outcomes by:
- Reducing equity risk in their strategic allocations and diversifying to assets that may outperform in negative growth shocks (bonds) and positive inflation shocks (commodities)
- Adding exposure to alternatives, particularly those that tend to capitalize on elevated volatility and outperform in equity market drawdowns, such as trend following and global macro
- Investors should diversify, at least partially, away from simple equity risk. Bonds and commodities in a strategic allocation can help mitigate poor equity market performance due to negative growth shocks (bonds) or positive inflation shocks (commodities). An 'equal risk' portfolio of stocks, bonds, and commodities — a simple 'risk parity' portfolio in which the weight on each asset class is inversely proportional to its realized volatility—delivers much more consistent performance across macroeconomic environments than equities (or any single asset class). 
- Many long-short liquid alternative strategies have little sensitivity to the macroeconomic backdrop and can provide strong performance across a range of market environments. Trend-following strategies, which at their core profit from the systematic tendency of markets to gradually incorporate new information, tend to outperform when economic shocks are large and markets experience stress.
