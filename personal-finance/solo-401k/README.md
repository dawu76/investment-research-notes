## Contribution Limits

### Solo 401k Limits for 2025

**Total Combined Limit**: $70,000 (or $77,500 if age 50+)

This breaks down into:

1. **Employee Contributions (Salary Deferrals)**
   - Under age 50: $23,500
   - Age 50 or older: $31,000 (includes $7,500 catch-up)
   - Can be Traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (after-tax)

2. **Employer Contributions (Profit Sharing)**
   - Up to 25% of "plan compensation" for self-employed
   - For sole proprietors, this works out to approximately 20% of net self-employment income
   - Always Traditional (pre-tax)

**Important**: The $23,500 employee contribution limit applies across ALL 401k plans you participate in. If you also have a W-2 job with a 401k, your total employee deferrals cannot exceed $23,500 across both plans.

### Traditional IRA Limits for 2025

**Contribution Limit**: $7,000 per person ($8,000 if age 50+)

**Deductibility**: Because you have a Solo 401k (which counts as an employer retirement plan), your Traditional IRA deduction may be limited based on your Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI):

For 2025 (married filing jointly):
- Full deduction if MAGI ≤ $126,000
- Partial deduction if MAGI between $126,000 - $146,000
- No deduction if MAGI ≥ $146,000

**Important**: You can always contribute to a Traditional IRA regardless of income, but the tax deduction may be limited or eliminated if you're covered by a workplace retirement plan (including a Solo 401k) and your income exceeds these thresholds.

## Employee vs. Employer Contributions

### How Much Can You Contribute in Each Capacity?

The calculation is nuanced for self-employed individuals. Here's how it works:

**Step 1: Calculate Net Self-Employment Income**
- Start with gross business income
- Subtract business expenses
- Subtract 1/2 of self-employment tax

**Step 2: Calculate Employee Contribution**
- Up to $23,500 (or $31,000 if age 50+)
- Limited to 100% of your net self-employment income
- This reduces your taxable income but NOT your self-employment tax

**Step 3: Calculate Employer Contribution**
- Take your net self-employment income (from Step 1)
- Multiply by approximately 20%
- **Important**: Do NOT subtract the employee contribution first
- The IRS provides worksheets in [Publication 560](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p560) for precise calculations

**Why ~20%?** The IRS rule states employer contributions can be up to 25% of "plan compensation," but for self-employed individuals, "plan compensation" is defined as net earnings from self-employment MINUS the plan contribution itself. This creates a circular calculation that resolves to approximately 20% of net self-employment income (technically: 25% ÷ 1.25 = 20%).

### Example Calculation

Let's use a hypothetical scenario where a sole proprietor has $60,000 in business income:

```
Gross Business Income:                           $60,000
Less: Business Expenses:                         -$5,000
Net Profit (Schedule C):                         $55,000

Self-Employment Tax Calculation:
  Net Profit × 92.35%*:                          $50,793
  Self-Employment Tax (15.3%):                   $7,771
  Deductible Portion (50%):                      $3,886

Net Self-Employment Income:
  Net Profit - (1/2 SE Tax):                     $51,114

Solo 401k Contributions:
  Employee Contribution (planned):               $8,000
  Employer Contribution (example):               $10,000
  (Maximum for this example is ~$10,223)

Total Solo 401k Contribution:                    $18,000
```

**Notes**:
- *The 92.35% multiplier accounts for the deductible portion of self-employment tax. This is the amount subject to self-employment tax calculation per IRS rules.
- This is illustrative. Always use IRS Publication 560 worksheets or consult a tax professional for exact calculations.
- The employee and employer contributions are calculated independently - do NOT subtract the employee contribution before calculating the employer contribution.

### Do You Need to "Declare" Employee vs. Employer Amounts?

**Yes, but it's mostly for your records**:

1. **Internal Documentation**
   - Create a salary reduction agreement by December 31, 2025
   - Keep this document in your records (don't file it with the IRS)
   - It specifies your intended employee deferral amount

2. **Brokerage Classification**
   - Most brokerages (E-Trade, Fidelity, Schwab) classify contributions as "employer" by default
   - You track the split yourself
   - For E-Trade specifically: Call their retirement team before year-end to reclassify contributions as employee deferrals if needed

3. **Tax Reporting**
   - As the plan administrator (which is you), you're responsible for reporting the split
   - This matters for Form 5500-EZ if your plan assets exceed $250,000
   - Both types are deducted the same way on your personal tax return (Schedule 1, Line 16)

### Tracking Template

Create a simple spreadsheet or document:

```
2025 Solo 401k Contributions - [Your Name]

Employee Deferrals (Traditional):
- Date: 2025-03-15 | Amount: $5,000
- Date: 2025-12-30 | Amount: $3,000
- Total Employee: $8,000

Employer Contributions:
- Date: 2026-04-10 | Amount: $10,000
- Total Employer: $10,000

Total 2025 Contributions: $18,000
```

## Tax Implications

### How Solo 401k Contributions Reduce Your Taxes

**For Sole Proprietors**:

Both employee and employer contributions are deducted on **Schedule 1, Line 16** of Form 1040 ("Self-employed SEP, SIMPLE, and qualified plans").

**Tax Benefits**:
- ✅ Reduces federal income tax
- ✅ Reduces state income tax (in most states)
- ❌ Does NOT reduce self-employment tax

**Important**: This is a common misconception. Solo 401k contributions do NOT reduce your self-employment tax (15.3% on net earnings) because:
- Self-employment tax is calculated on Schedule C net profit
- Solo 401k contributions are deducted on Schedule 1 (after Schedule C)
- Your Schedule C net profit remains unchanged

### Employee vs. Employer Contributions: Tax Efficiency

**For sole proprietors, there is NO tax difference between employee and employer contributions**:
- Both are deducted on Schedule 1, Line 16
- Both reduce your Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)
- Both reduce your federal and state income tax
- Neither reduces self-employment tax

**Why it matters**: Understanding this helps you focus on the practical considerations:
- Employee contributions must be decided by year-end
- Employer contributions can be decided when you file your taxes
- Employee contributions can be Roth (after-tax) if you want tax-free growth
- Employer contributions are always Traditional (pre-tax)

### Impact on Other Tax Benefits

**Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI)**:
- Solo 401k contributions reduce your AGI
- Your MAGI = AGI + certain add-backs (IRA deductions, student loan interest, etc.)
- Lower MAGI can help you qualify for:
  - Traditional IRA deductions
  - Roth IRA contributions
  - Premium tax credits (ACA)
  - Other income-based tax benefits

**Example**: If your AGI before Solo 401k contributions is $55,000 and you contribute $18,000 to your Solo 401k, your AGI drops to approximately $37,000, which may help you qualify for additional tax benefits.

## Spousal IRA Contributions

### Spousal Traditional IRA Rules

If your spouse has little or no earned income, you can still contribute to their Traditional IRA based on your income.

**Requirements**:
- You must be married filing jointly
- You must have enough earned income to cover both IRA contributions
- Your spouse can contribute up to $7,000 (or $8,000 if age 50+)

**Deductibility for Spouse**:

If your spouse is NOT covered by a workplace retirement plan, the deduction limits are much more generous:

For 2025 (married filing jointly):
- Full deduction if MAGI ≤ $236,000
- Partial deduction if MAGI between $236,000 - $246,000
- No deduction if MAGI ≥ $246,000

**Important**: Even if YOU are covered by a Solo 401k, your spouse may still get a full deduction if:
1. They are not covered by their own workplace retirement plan, AND
2. Your combined MAGI is below $236,000

### Planned Contributions Summary

Based on your scenario:
- Your Traditional IRA: $7,000
- Spouse's Traditional IRA: $7,000
- Solo 401k: ~$18,000 (split between employee and employer)
- **Total tax-advantaged savings**: ~$32,000

---

## Important Considerations

### 1. Self-Employment Tax Cannot Be Reduced

Many people mistakenly believe Solo 401k contributions reduce self-employment tax. They don't.

**What you CAN deduct for SE tax purposes**:
- Business expenses (Schedule C)
- 1/2 of self-employment tax (automatic deduction)

**What you CANNOT deduct for SE tax purposes**:
- Solo 401k contributions (deducted on Schedule 1, not Schedule C)
- Traditional IRA contributions
- Health insurance premiums (also Schedule 1)

### 2. Order of Operations for Tax Planning

1. **December 31, 2025**: Decide on employee contribution amount (salary deferral)
2. **Throughout 2025**: Make estimated tax payments based on expected contributions
3. **By April 15, 2026**:
   - Calculate exact employer contribution using IRS worksheets
   - Make both employee and employer contributions
   - Make Traditional IRA contributions (yours and spouse)
   - File tax return (or extension)

### 3. Brokerage-Specific Procedures

Each brokerage handles Solo 401k contributions differently:

**E-Trade**:
- Defaults all contributions to "employer"
- Call retirement team before year-end to reclassify as employee deferrals
- You track the split yourself

**Fidelity/Schwab**:
- May have different default classifications
- Check with your specific provider
- Always maintain your own records

### 4. Form 5500-EZ Filing Requirement

If your Solo 401k assets exceed $250,000 at year-end, you must file Form 5500-EZ by July 31 of the following year.

This form requires you to report:
- Employee vs. employer contribution split
- Plan assets and liabilities
- Your business EIN and Solo 401k plan EIN

### 5. EIN Requirements

**Your Business**:
- As a sole proprietor, you can use your SSN
- Or get a business EIN (recommended for privacy)

**Your Solo 401k Plan**:
- Needs its own separate EIN
- Apply online at IRS.gov
- Select "Employer Plan (401k, Money Purchase Plan, etc.)"
- Takes ~5 minutes, issued immediately

### 6. Record Keeping

Maintain records for at least 7 years:
- Salary reduction agreements
- Contribution tracking spreadsheet
- Bank/brokerage statements showing deposits
- Tax returns
- Form 5500-EZ (if filed)

### 7. Maximum Contribution Strategy

If you want to maximize tax-advantaged savings:

**Option A: Front-load employee contributions**
- Max employee: $23,500
- Calculated employer: ~$5,000-7,000 (depending on income)
- Pros: Roth option available for employee contributions
- Cons: Must decide by year-end

**Option B: Balance employee and employer**
- Moderate employee: $15,000-18,000
- Higher employer: ~$8,000-12,000
- Pros: More flexibility in timing
- Cons: Employer must be Traditional (pre-tax)

**Option C: Minimize employee, maximize employer**
- Minimal employee: $0-5,000
- Max employer: Up to ~20% of net income
- Pros: Can decide employer amount at tax time
- Cons: No Roth option, smaller total if income is lower

### 8. Estimated Tax Planning

Don't forget to adjust your quarterly estimated tax payments to account for:
- Reduced taxable income from Solo 401k contributions
- Reduced taxable income from Traditional IRA contributions
- You may be able to reduce Q4 2025 estimated payment if you make year-end employee deferrals

### 9. State Tax Implications

Most states follow federal treatment:
- Solo 401k contributions reduce state taxable income
- Traditional IRA contributions reduce state taxable income
- Check your specific state (some states like California may have different rules)
