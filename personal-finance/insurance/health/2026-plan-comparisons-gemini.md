## Hypothetical Scenarios (Corrected)

**Disclaimer:** These scenarios are complex and involve several assumptions about how costs are applied to deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums. The actual costs may vary.

**Correction Note:** A previous version of this analysis for the Silver 70 HMO plan incorrectly applied the deductible to outpatient surgery costs. The tables below have been corrected to reflect that outpatient surgery is subject to 30% coinsurance without first meeting the deductible.

**Assumptions:**
*   An emergency room visit costs $2,000.
*   For total costs of $6,000, $8,000, and $12,000, the remainder of the cost is for outpatient surgery.
*   For total costs of $16,000 and $20,000, the remainder of the cost is for a brief hospital stay (inpatient).

## Understanding Individual vs. Family Out-of-Pocket Maximums

A common question regarding family health plans is how costs accumulate when multiple family members require significant medical care. The following analysis clarifies the relationship between individual and family out-of-pocket maximums (OOPM) by exploring a specific scenario: a situation where 1, 2, or 3 family members each incur enough medical expenses to reach their individual OOPM.

### The Rules of OOPM Accumulation

The key is that there are two sets of limits working at the same time: **individual** and **family**.

1.  **Individual Limits:** No single person will ever pay more than their *individual out-of-pocket maximum* (OOPM) in a year.
2.  **Family Limits:** The total combined spending of all family members will never exceed the *family out-of-pocket maximum* (OOPM). Once this family limit is reached, the plan pays 100% of covered costs for every member for the rest of the year, regardless of whether they've met their individual limits.

Both the **Bronze 60 HMO** and the **Silver 70 HMO** plans have the same out-of-pocket maximums:
*   **Individual Out-of-Pocket Maximum:** $9,800
*   **Family Out-of-Pocket Maximum:** $19,600

Because this scenario assumes each person incurs enough medical expenses to hit their individual limit, the specific deductibles and coinsurance rates don't change the final outcome, only how quickly each person reaches their maximum. Therefore, the total out-of-pocket costs will be the same for both plans in these specific scenarios.

### Out-of-Pocket Expense Scenarios

Here is the breakdown of the total family out-of-pocket costs for each situation:

| Number of Family Members Reaching Their Individual OOPM | Total Family Out-of-Pocket Cost | How it Works |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1 Member** | **$9,800** | The first family member pays for their services until their spending hits their individual OOPM of $9,800. Their costs are now capped. The family as a whole has spent $9,800. |
| **2 Members** | **$19,600** | The first member pays their full individual OOPM of $9,800. The second member then begins paying for their services until their spending also reaches $9,800. At that exact moment, the family's total spending ($9,800 + $9,800) hits the **Family OOPM of $19,600**. |
| **3 Members** | **$19,600** | The first two members' costs cause the family to hit the **Family OOPM of $19,600**, as described above. When the third family member begins to require services, they pay **$0** for all covered services because the family's maximum contribution for the year has already been met. |

## Appendix: Calculation Methodology

This appendix explains the cost calculation logic used in the "Hypothetical Scenarios" section.

### General Assumptions

*   **Out-of-Pocket (OOP) Costs** include deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance.
*   **Total Annual Cost** is the sum of the estimated OOP Cost for the scenario plus the total Annual Premiums.
*   **Out-of-Pocket Maximums (OOPM):** All calculations are capped by the individual and family OOPMs. Once a person or family reaches their OOPM, they pay nothing more for covered services for the rest of the year.

### Plan-Specific Logic

**Bronze 60 HMO**

Under this plan, most services are subject to the deductible first. This means you pay 100% of the cost for services until you meet your deductible. After the deductible is met, you pay 40% coinsurance.

*   **Calculation Example (Scenario 1, $12,000 cost):**
    1.  **Meet Deductible:** The individual pays the first **$5,800** of the $12,000 bill to satisfy their individual deductible.
    2.  **Pay Coinsurance:** The remaining bill is $12,000 - $5,800 = $6,200. The individual pays 40% of this amount: 0.40 * $6,200 = **$2,480**.
    3.  **Total OOP Cost:** $5,800 (deductible) + $2,480 (coinsurance) = **$8,280**.

**Silver 70 HMO**

This plan uses a mix of copays and coinsurance, with different deductible rules for different services.

*   **Emergency Room (ER):** A flat **$400 copay**. This does not count towards the deductible.
*   **Outpatient Surgery:** **30% coinsurance**. This also does not require the deductible to be met first.
*   **Inpatient Services:** These services **require the deductible to be met** before the 30% coinsurance applies.

*   **Calculation Example (Scenario 1, $12,000 outpatient cost):**
    1.  **ER Visit:** The individual pays the **$400** copay for the $2,000 ER portion of the bill.
    2.  **Pay Coinsurance:** The remaining $10,000 is for outpatient surgery. The deductible does not apply, so the individual pays 30% coinsurance: 0.30 * $10,000 = **$3,000**.
    3.  **Total OOP Cost:** $400 (copay) + $3,000 (coinsurance) = **$3,400**.

*   **Calculation Example (Scenario 1, $16,000 inpatient cost):**
    1.  **ER Visit:** The individual pays the **$400** copay.
    2.  **Meet Deductible:** The remaining $14,000 is for inpatient services, which requires the deductible. The individual pays the first **$5,200** to satisfy their deductible.
    3.  **Pay Coinsurance:** The remaining bill is $14,000 - $5,200 = $8,800. The individual pays 30% of this: 0.30 * $8,800 = **$2,640**.
    4.  **Total OOP Cost:** $400 (copay) + $5,200 (deductible) + $2,640 (coinsurance) = **$8,240**.

### Family Deductible and OOPM Logic (Scenario 2)

When multiple family members have costs, their individual spending contributes to the family-level limits.

*   **Family Deductible:** The plan doesn't pay coinsurance for any member (for services subject to the deductible) until the total family deductible is met by one or more members' spending.
*   **Family OOPM:** The total combined out-of-pocket spending for all family members is capped at the family OOPM.
