### Global macro vs. CTA

Global macro strategy definitions
- This is a flexible strategy whose positions are based on views regarding the economic and geopolitical prospects of various countries. These views are informed by interest rates, politics, domestic and foreign poilcies, international trade, currency exchange rates, etc.
- Holdings may include long and short positions in various equity, fixed income, currency, commodities, and futures markets. The funds may take directional or relative value bets.

3 primary types of global macro funds
- discretionary global macro: in these funds, the PMs take a high-level view of global markets and allocate funds to asset classes accordingly in a flexible, discretionary manner
- CTAS: these funds rely primarily on trend-following algorithms to go long or short different assets (commodities, currencies, etc.)
- systematic global macro: these funds blend a discretionary and CTA-based approach

- This post evaluates the performance of two common strategies: 1) If weak absolute performance appears, go to cash; 2) If weak trending performance appears, go to cash.
- These rules together constitute the "Downside Protection Model" based on Time-series Momentum (TMOM) and Simple Moving Averages (SMA).
- Time Series (Absolute) Momentum Rule (TMOM) Excess return = total return over the past 12 months less return of T-Bills > 0, go long risky assets. Otherwise, go long alternative assets (T-Bills)
- Simple Moving Average (Trending Performance) Rule (MA): If Current Price â€“ Moving Average (12) > 0, go long risky assets. Otherwise, go long alternative assets (T-Bills).
