### Week 02

#### Commodity Carry Trade (in the 1980s)

Commodity futures contracts
- sold by commodity producers / suppliers to lock in the prices they can earn for their resources (e.g. oil); sellers of contracts agree to deliver 10,000 barrels of oil
- purchased by commodity users to lock in the prices they pay for the resources (e.g. airlines and logistics firms buying oil); buyers of contracts agree to take delivery of 10,000 barrels of oil

Persistent discount of futures contract price
- the supply of futures contracts sold by producers usually outweighed the demand for those contracts (hedges) by buyers; this supply-demand imbalance caused the futures contract price to be consistently less than the spot price by ~5%, e.g. the spot price might be $20 while the December futures price would be $19
- this futures contract price discount attracted speculators who bought the contract and held it to (almost) expiration in the hopes that the spot and futures price would converge; the expectation was that typically the spot price would remain relatively unchanged while the futures price would rise to converge to the spot price

What role did speculators play? they took on risk in order to earn a positive expected return
- speculators provided a useful service: they provided demand for the futures contracts sold by producers; otherwise producers would not be able to lock in prices for their products, or they would be able to lock in very low prices
- it was not a riskless trade for speculators, as the spot could fall, causing the futures position to either not rise or even fall; on occasion the spot would rise, in which case the futures contract would see a greater than 5% return

Disappearance of this edge
- in the mid-2000s, the futures price started to trade at a premium to spot
- due to an increasing number of speculators and CTA funds trying to take advantage of this edge, the demand for these futures contracts started to outweight the supply, causing the futures price to actually exceed the spot price

#### Risk Premia Harvesting

Uncertain payoffs and expected returns
- Two games may have the same expected return, but if Game 1 has a certain payoff while Game 2 has an uncertain payoff (e.g. lose $100 with 50% probability and win $300 with 50% probability), then Game 1 is preferable.
- If Game 2's expected return is higher than Game 1's, then it may be preferable. It depends on whether we can take advantage of the edge, e.g. we can play the game many times with small enough bets to avoid total ruin.
- Let's think in terms of risky assets instead of games. What if you had one asset that guaranteed a certain return and another asset with the same expected return but with an uncertain payoff (e.g. a chance of losing 50% or gaining 100%)? In that case, no one would want to purchase the risky asset when they could earn the same expected return with zero risk.
- But then without any buyers, the price of the second asset would drop until the asset's supply and demand roughly equalize. After this price drop, its expected return might exceed that of the risk-free asset.
- This is what happens with financial assets, e.g. risk-free T-bills earning 2% versus risky stocks with uncertain payoffs. Or stable blue-chip dividend-paying companies versus early stage growth companies. The prices of the riskier assets should be low enough so that their expected return exceeds that of the risk-free asset.
- Note that bonds, even T-bills, are not risk-free, as they are subject to the risk of inflation and rising interest rates. When interest rates rise, bonds with a given yield become less attractive. This reduces the number of buyers of that bond, causing its price to fall. After this price drop, the bond's yield increases, making it relatively more attractive again. But this price drop hurts the current holders of the bond. They can choose to hold the bond to maturity, in which case they likely won't suffer an actual loss on their bond position. But the value of the bond's coupon payments is now less attractive relative to other alternatives.
