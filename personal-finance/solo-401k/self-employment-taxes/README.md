## Fact or Fiction? Do Solo 401k Contributions Reduce Self-Employment Taxes?

Who is self-employed?
- According to the IRS, you are self-employed if you are a sole proprietor (including an independent contractor); a partner in a partnership (including a member of a multi-member LLC), or you’re in business by yourself. A sole proprietor also includes the member of a single-member LLC that is disregarded for federal income tax purposes and members of a qualified joint venture.
- If you are self-employed, your FICA tax rate for 2025 is 15.3%. The self-employment rate is the sum of a 12.4% Social Security tax and a 2.9% Medicare tax on net earnings. For 2025, the first $176,100 of your combined wages, tips, and net earnings is subject to any combination of the Social Security part of self-employment tax, Social Security tax, or railroad retirement (tier 1) tax.

For Sole Proprietors & Single-Member LLCs
- Where Employer Contributions Are Deducted: Schedule 1 of Form 1040 (NOT Schedule C)
- Impact on self-employment tax: ❌ NONE – Net profit stays the same

**Key Insight**: Solo 401k contributions are deducted on Schedule 1 of Form 1040, NOT on Schedule C. This means your net profit (which is used to calculate self-employment tax) remains unchanged. The 15.3% self-employment tax is calculated based on your Schedule C net profit, which isn’t affected by retirement plan contributions.

For a sole proprietor, pre-tax (i.e., “traditional”) contributions (whether they’re employee or employer contributions) will be deducted on line 28 of Form 1040 under “Self-employed SEP, SIMPLE, and qualified plans.” Because pre-tax employer and employee contributions are deducted in the same way, neither one is more tax-efficient than the other.

## Rules and deadlines

- ✅ Employer Contributions: Generally up to 25% of your net business profit' after subtracting 1/2 of your self-employment tax (or around 20% if you’re not incorporated). These contributions typically go into a traditional (pre-tax) Solo 401k, as Roth options may not be available with all plans.

- Sole Prop/LLC: Both employee & employer amounts are generally deducted on Schedule 1, Line 16 of Form 1040.
- Note from E-Trade: _"Tracking and reporting of contributions is the responsibility of the account owner. Please review the contribution limits and speak with your tax advisor to ensure you do not exceed your contribution limit. E*TRADE will show Individual 401(k) contributions as **employer** contributions and Individual Roth 401(k) contributions as **employee** contributions in the transaction history. You must track employee vs employer contributions and report based on your own records."_ Refer to the sample '401k Salary Reduction Agreement' [pdf](https://www.fidelity.com/bin-public/060_www_fidelity_com/documents/customer-service/401k-salary-reduction-agreement.pdf) linked on Fidelity's site.

✅ Contribution Deadlines
- For Employee contributions: Per carry.com and fidelity.com, you _'need to file Solo 401k & deferral election by EOY, e.g. 2025-12-31. This informs the IRS of how much you intend to contribute and whether the amount will go into a pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth) Solo 401k. This amount determines your contribution amount and whether it’s Roth or pre-tax ... If you have an unincorporated business, you (and your spouse if they are an employee of the business) must make a written salary deferral election before the end of the year. Employees of incorporated businesses must make a written salary deferral election before they can begin deferring from paychecks and that must be before the end of the business's tax year.'_ However, this 'written salary deferral election' is just an internal document. Per Fidelity's instructions: _"Please keep this form for your own records. There is no need to send a copy to Fidelity."_
- 2024 contributions: Due by March 15, 2025 (S corps, multi-member LLCs, partnerships) or April 15, 2025 (C corps, sole proprietors, single-member LLCs).
- 2025 contributions: Due by March 15, 2026 or April 15, 2026, depending on business type. Extensions available for an additional 6 months.

IRA contribution limits if you have a solo 401k
- Your Solo 401k contributions don't directly reduce your IRA contribution amount, but they do affect whether your IRA contributions are deductible, based on your Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) and if you're covered by a workplace plan (which a Solo 401k is).
- There’s no income cap for contributing to a Traditional IRA, but your tax deduction may be limited if you participate in a 401k or Solo 401k and your income exceeds certain thresholds. Your Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) determines if you qualify for certain tax benefits, including IRA deductions and Roth IRA contributions. It starts with your Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) and then adds back specific items the IRS excludes when calculating taxable income. AGI is your total income minus “above-the-line” deductions such as self-employment tax, traditional IRA contributions, or student loan interest. Once you have your AGI, the IRS requires you to add back certain amounts to find your MAGI.
