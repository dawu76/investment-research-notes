NXtrador: I have a GPT5 project with a fairly long running convo. This morning I pasted the 4 screeenshots for funnel pages and the cockpit and this prompt: "Ok look at the funnel with me and propose the best trades."

... I like asking it about upcoming events. One thing I'm interested in is the automation of a workflow where it reads the letters you subscribe to. So for example having it ingest Citrini or Brent Donnelly's daily letter. Both for ideas that start from "non vol lens" and because of better event awareness.

```
Step 1. Steepness vs IV Percentile (Funnel)
• RGTI (circled): Low IV percentile (~5%), steepness ~105. Back month not cheap vs. front → not a clean calendar. More of a “vega-long bet” if you think implied vols rise from the floor.
• AMC / RBLX / TSLA: Higher steepness with mid IV percentiles. These often reward calendars (sell front, buy back).
• ETH / SOFI / PLTR: IV percentile ~60, steepness flat-ish → more suited for outright short vol.

⸻

Step 2. RV Percentile vs VRP
• GME / NVDA / AMC: high RV percentile, still some VRP premium → not obvious short vol (realized is confirming). Better for directional with long optionality.
• RGTI / MARA / TSLA: Low RV percentile and modest positive VRP. These cluster into the “sell vol works” zone.
• COIN / CRCL: Negative VRP — market is underpricing realized. Don’t sell these.

⸻

Step 3. Skew table
• PLTR / QQQ / SPY / MSTR: extreme 10d–25d put skew percentiles (90s). Put wing protection is expensive → short puts / put spreads are appealing if you want to lean long.
• NVO / HIMS (healthcare), APP (software): call skew is extreme (98%ile). Upside protection expensive → good environments for selling calls / call spreads.

⸻

Step 4. Cockpit
• MARA / RIOT / ETH: vol snapshots in 60–70% range, VRP ~10–20%, weekly realized calmer. Fits short-vol profile.
• RGTI: 82% 30d IV but RV percentile only ~11%. That’s a classic short vol mispricing (high implied vs calm realized).
• NVDA: massive recent realized volatility, IV lagging (VRP positive but risky).

Top 3 Trades Right Now
    
RGTI (Quantum) — Short Vol Play
•    IV percentile low, but IV itself elevated vs realized. VRP modest positive.
•    Trade: Short straddle/strangle or iron condor. If you want structure: ATM short straddle front month.
•    Rationale: implied vols are too fat for the realized environment.
MARA / RIOT (Crypto miners) — Short Vol, Defined Risk
•    Both show VRP positive, RV percentile low, vols still pumped by crypto beta.
•    Trade: Sell OTM strangles or iron condors. If you want directional hedge, lean short puts since skew is rich.
•    Rationale: the crypto vols remain overpriced vs realized, but skew gives you a tilt.
AMC / RBLX — Calendar / Diagonal Play
•    Funnel: steepness higher, IV percentiles mid.
•    Trade: Sell front-month ATM straddle, buy back-month same strike (classic calendar).
•    Rationale: front vol overpriced relative to back; realized vol high but mean-reverting.

Summary:
• Pure short vol: RGTI, MARA, RIOT.
• Calendars: AMC, RBLX.
• Avoid: COIN, CRCL (negative VRP, realized too hot).
• Directional long vol: NVDA, GME (realized still exploding).

More AI commentary posted by NXTrader.
- good calendar setup: steeper curve with front month more expensive than back month.
- high negative skew: puts overpriced vs. calls -> sell puts or do risk reversals
- very low RV, IV just slightly higher -> small iron condor or short straddle
- high RV, IV catching up. Good for long gamma if you want to ride momentum -> directional long calls or call spreads.

Background definitions
- Iron Condor: a risk-defined way to profit from low volatility by selling an out-of-the-money (OTM) bull put spread and an OTM bull call spread, collecting a net credit upfront. Bull put spread: sell a higher-strike put and buying a lower-strike put -> credit spread that profits if stock price > short put strike. Bear call spread: sell a lower-strike call and buy a higher-strike call --> credit spread that profits if the stock stays below the short call strike. So you're betting that the stock will stay within the strikes of the short put and short call.

As long as the stock or exchange-traded fund (ETF) stays within a set range, the sold options expire worthless, allowing traders to keep the premium while benefiting from time decay. While profits are capped, so are losses, making it a high-probability, structured strategy

Key concepts from this response

- Higher steepness with mid IV percentiles. These often reward calendars (sell front month, buy back month).

- Negative VRP — market is underpricing realized. Don’t sell these.
- vol snapshots in 60–70% range, VRP ~10–20%, weekly realized calmer ➡️ fits short-vol profile
- 82% 30d IV but RV percentile only ~11%. That’s a classic short vol mispricing (high implied vs calm realized)
- massive recent realized volatility, IV lagging (VRP positive but risky).

Volatility Trade Presets - "Effects Pedal" Settings [claude.ai artifact](https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/98e46f3e-12d1-4dba-a530-15f30b62edde?fullscreen=false)

Like guitar effects pedals with preset knob positions for specific sounds, vol trading needs preset "dial positions" for consistent trade setups. Each preset defines the exact market conditions that trigger a specific trade structure.

**Preset Combinations**

Like chaining effects pedals, you can combine presets:
- "CALENDAR INTO SKEW": Start with Preset 1, if skew develops use Preset 4
- "VOL EXPLOSION INTO CLEAN SELLING": Start with Preset 5 to catch vol spike, then Preset 3 to sell it back down

**Calibration Notes**

Just like adjusting pedal settings for different guitars/amps, these presets need tweaking based on:
- Market regime: low-vol vs high-vol environment
- Sector characteristics: tech vs utilities behave differently
- Liquidity constraints: wide bid-asks require different positioning
- Portfolio correlation: don't stack similar presets

**PRESET 1: "SMOOTH CALENDAR FUZZ"**

Classic **calendar spread** setup

Dial Settings:
- IV Percentile: 10-40% (vol compressed but not dead)
- VRP: +15% to +35% (positive but not extreme)
- Steepness: 105-115 (moderate term structure slope)
- Skew: 40-70% (normal range, not extreme)

Trade: Sell front month ATM, buy back month ATM
Sound: Smooth time decay with vol expansion protection

**PRESET 2: "DISTORTED REVERSE CALENDAR"**

Aggressive front month buying

Dial Settings:
- IV Percentile: 5-25% (vol very compressed)
- VRP: +20% to +50% (high premium)
- Steepness: 115+ (front month severely cheap vs back)
- Skew: Any (structure-agnostic)

Trade: Buy front month, sell back month
Sound: Explosive upside if vol mean-reverts quickly
