### RW Pro onboarding notes

---

Highlights
- RW Pro API key: use API to pull weights into spreadsheet or some other application
- Research pods to house clean data and libraries for cleaning and analyzing data: use Google Colab notebooks to share code snippets of common code patterns / queries
- What's in the "Lab"? Edge database: maintained in Github, in the form of a spreadsheet or Kanban board, that collects info about the edges that RW has investigated before. On main page, click on Lab > Lab HQ > Course Content with videos
- Macro Pod: organized in similar way, with research findings and scripts, and links to any datasets; click on one of the research notebooks to see a walk-through of the findings and code; the notebook will pull code from APIs or from files in Github; occasionally, there may be changes in Colab or libraries that cause the code to break - if that happens, ask for help on Discord.
- In Colab, go to the settings cog and authorize it to have access to Github; also check the option to access private repos;
