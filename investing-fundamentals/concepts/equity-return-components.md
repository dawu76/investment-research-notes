### Equity return components

Equities performance be separated into four components: 

1) inflation
2) dividends
3) earnings-per-share growth
4) valuation

In other words, a stock’s real performance equals the dividends that it pays, multiplied by its change in earnings per share, multiplied by the change in price multiple that the stock commands—to which inflation’s effect must be considered.

Note: Real returns plus inflation do not necessarily sum to nominal returns because the components of investment performance are multiplicative, not additive. For example, a stock that records a 4% capital gain while paying a 4% dividend has an 8.16% total return.

Return for these components over the period of June 2014 - May 2024:

1) inflation: 2.82%
2) dividends: 1.87%
3) earnings-per-share growth: 3.82%
4) valuation: 3.63%

Annualized after-inflation returns, June 2014 - May 2024:
- S&P 500: 9.6%
- Mainstream Estimate: 8.56%
- Experts' Estimate: 5.13%
- Pessimists Estimate: 0.25%
