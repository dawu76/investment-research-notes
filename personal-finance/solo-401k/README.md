### Other Questions

Is a solo 401k considered a separate capacity for SIPC?
- Yes, a solo 401k is considered a separate capacity for SIPC protection, meaning that if you have a regular brokerage account and a solo 401k at the same brokerage, each account would be insured up to the $500,000 limit, as long as the brokerage is a SIPC member; essentially treating them as distinct accounts with separate coverage.
- SIPC considers different types of accounts held by a single individual at the same brokerage as separate capacities, allowing each account to be insured up to the maximum limit.
- If you have multiple individual accounts at the same brokerage, they are not considered separate capacities and are combined for coverage purposes.
