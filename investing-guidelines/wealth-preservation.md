Sizing investments
- The optimal amount that we want to bet on some opportunity is proportional to how attractive it is, what the odds are in our favor, but it also is proportional to the risk that’s involved in that investment or that gamble. And what we also find is that as the attractiveness goes up, we want to bet more and more in a proportional way. But as the risk goes up, we want to bet less and less, but in a quadratic way, in a squared way. So, increases in risk bite more quickly than increases in expected return.

Expected future returns and asset allocation
- We believe that your asset allocation should be a function of what is the expected return on all the different assets that you can own and what’s their riskiness like.
- Looking at US equities and feeling that they have something like a 3% long-term real return over a very long horizon and recognizing that, say, 30-year TIPS are right around 2% is saying that if you own US equities, you should expect to make about 1% more than a relatively safe asset with a comparable payout in terms of it being inflation adjusted. And that’s really low. And we think that as a result that people probably shouldn’t have all that much invested in US equities. Then there’s the risk component to it. We’re at a relatively low risk or low volatility state. So that might bump up how much you’re willing to own of US equities. But if we go back into a higher volatility state, you’ll really want to own very little US equities at all, I would say.
- Fortunately, the rest of the world looks a lot more attractive than that. And so, despite—and we’ll talk about this maybe later—but despite the incredibly disappointing returns of non-US equities relative to US equities, we think that for long-term investors, they offer a much more attractive return and should be a bigger part of one’s portfolio.
