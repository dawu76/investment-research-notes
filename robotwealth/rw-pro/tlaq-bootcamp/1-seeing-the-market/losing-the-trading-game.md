## Losing the trading game

Run your trading like a business. Trading is a business like any other. You need to understand how you can compete at it and put a sensible plan together.
- Just as the car dealer concentrates on finding desperate buyers and sellers in an uncompetitive market environment, and on accepting and managing risk, so should you. The car dealer isn’t off fucking spiders. He’s not building predictive models for car prices (he can buy that) and he’s not consulting the star charts or whatever. He’s working on the simple core disciplines that make a difference.
- And so should you. You can’t afford to mess around. You’ve got to find where you can be of service, doing something useful in an uncompetitive environment. Nearly everything other than that is trying to fuck spiders.
- So step 1 is to let go of any magical thinking about trading. You won’t outsmart the market. You need a realistic plan, based on doing things people value in uncompetitive places.

And, now, there, I’ve mostly told you everything covered in the first half of the course. The rest is detail, elaboration, and a ton of examples.

It’s pretty clear how the used car dealer makes money, I think.  The basic game, of course, is this.
- You need to find a source of cheap cars.
- You stick them in your yard, mark up the price and wait for a customer to come along that likes one of them and is prepared to pay a premium for it through convenience, or because it’s just the one they’ve been looking for, or whatever. 

In summary, they:
- Buy cheap
- Sell rich
- Accept and manage risk

One strategy to find cheap cars is to find people with a lot of them that are keen to get rid of them quickly – leasing or rental companies, for example. You can help them out by taking whatever they have off their hands quickly and they’ll be happy to sell them to you at a discount because they are not in the business of holding inventory that doesn’t make money, nor are they in the business of selling cars. You’re finding motivated (or desperate) sellers and helping them out. They’re happy to get rid of the car quickly at a discount to free capital and reduce risk. And you’re happy you got the cars for a good price. 

And the main strategy for selling cars above market price is the opposite. You have to wait for the motivated or desperate buyer who is prepared to overpay. He’s happy he got the car of his dreams in a quick and easy fashion. You’re happy you got above market value for it.

What’s the risk? Well, the risk is mostly those cars losing value on the lot. Whilst you wait for a desperate buyer to take the car off the lot, the cars are slowly losing value. And changes in the market, economy, politics, or culture can impact the price of all of your inventory at the same time.  So your business requires you to accept and take on risk, otherwise,you won’t get paid. But you have to manage it. You don’t want too many of the same type or the same model… you’ll have to cut the price or do an offer if a car has been on the lot a long time. And you want to avoid taking risks you don’t think you’ll get paid for. You want to be smart about it.

The fact that the business is risky is actually kind of important because we do business in a competitive environment. If it were simple, easy, and low-risk to run a used car yard, many more people would be doing it. So it’s important that it’s a bit risky or involves some work or is a bit awkward, otherwise you’re going to find it a lot harder to buy cheap or sell rich because many others will be doing it too. They will be in competition with you to try to buy cheap from desperate sellers and sell rich to desperate buyers.

These concepts are all crucial to the business of trading or investing too. On a trivial level it’s obvious, I think, that successful trading also requires you to buy things that are too cheap and sell things that are too rich. And that, in the space between buying and selling, you accumulate exposures that are risky.
- You buy a stock. You might have bought it cheap based on everything it’s possible to know today but the future is unknowable and unpredictable. So, that stock can go down as well as up. And political or economic shocks are likely to hurt if they manifest.
- But just as accepting and managing risk is a crucial part of the used car dealers business model, so it is to the trader. Without some risk, there can be no return.

Buying Cheap, Selling Rich, and Accepting and Managing Risk is important in trading. And the discipline is the same. 
- First, we need to find other traders who are willing or forced to buy from us too cheap or sell to us too rich. And it turns out that bit actually isn’t particularly hard. It’s quite easy to find traders who are keen to avoid or reduce risk, or literally are forced to – and if you can trade with them then you’re likely to be buying cheap or selling rich because they are forced and you are patient. Picture the trader with large leveraged positions in a market crash. Risk metrics flashing red, they are forced to sell to cut size. They might not want to, but they have to. Maybe their prime broker is on the phone telling them to. If you have desperate sellers and patient buyers you know what’s going to happen ... the sellers will be forced to sell at a discount. And you will be able to buy cheap if you get to trade with them. So, your first mission is to find _desperate, forced, misaligned, or otherwise price-insensitive traders to help out_.
- Just as the car dealer isn’t really in competition with his supplier and customers, you’re not in competition with the traders you’re helping out. They’re happy to reduce risk or get whatever they needed done, and you’re happy to have traded at a good price. You’re actually in competition with other traders trying to do the same thing as you. The car dealer is in competition with local dealerships that are also looking to buy cheap cars and sell expensive cars. If you trade in the financial markets, you are in competition with literally every other serious active player in the market. Including those far better, faster, and better set up than you are. So one of the very most crucial things is to be minimizing competition. You want to be helping these people out in as uncompetitive an environment as you can find.
- This means there has got to be something **unattractive** about the opportunity. Maybe the opportunity is small, you couldn’t get much money in it. Maybe it involves taking on significant risk. Or it’s a bit murky. Or it’s labor-intensive or capital-intensive. _You want to know what sucks about it – because you want to know why you can compete at it._
- If you’ve found an opportunity and can’t identify **what sucks about it**, then you probably haven’t found an opportunity. You don’t want to be trying to outsmart and out-gun other traders in a highly competitive zero-sum game. You can’t win those. Rather, you want to be looking to do useful things people value in as uncompetitive an arena as you can.
