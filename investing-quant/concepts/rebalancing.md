### Rebalancing

#### Optimal times to rebalance

"More frequent rebalancing will on average have little impact on risk reduction, even less benefit from a return perspective, and just racks up unnecessary transaction costs along the way ... The research suggests a superior rebalancing methodology is to allow portfolio allocations to drift slightly, and trigger a rebalancing trade **only if a target threshold is reached**. If the investments grow in line and the relative weightings don’t change, no rebalancing trade occurs. However, if these “rebalancing tolerance bands” are breached, the investment – and only the investment – that crosses the line, is then bought or sold to bring it back within the bands."

Rebalancing presents the opportunity to generate better returns – particularly when rebalancing amongst investments with similar long-term return potential – as the process of selling what has become overweight and buying is underweight can indirectly help investors to systematically sell high and buy low. In essence, the goal is to find investments that have moved to extremes, and trigger a rebalancing trade that buys/sell the investment just before it “snaps back” and reverts towards its long-term average.

What happens if we rebalance too frequently (e.g. monthly)?
- For a position that's doing well, you can end up selling portions of a position while it still has room to run.
- For a position about to decline in a year-long crash, you can end up buying more shares that experience the subsequent decline as the investment continues its path downwards.
- In the short-to-intermediate term, an investment can have significant relative outperformance or underperformance extending for months or even years at a time. Rebalancing too frequently curtails the positive momentum and adds too quickly into the negative.

How much of a difference does the rebalance timing frequency make?
- A study from Vanguard, by Jaconetti, Kinniry and Zilbering, basically found no material differences in outcomes for rebalancing frequencies varying from monthly to annual. Because a diversified portfolio has a wide range of investments, which do not necessarily peak and trough over the same time intervals, it’s difficult to find an optimal rebalancing frequency.

Alternatives to time-based rebalancing frequency
- Setting the thresholds for target allocation bands **on a relative basis** – e.g., 20% of the target weighting itself – creates a mechanism where any one particular investment that moves to a high or low extreme will be sold or bought accordingly, because its performance is so different than everything else.
- Rather than forcing a rebalancing transaction for all investments in the portfolio – whether necessary or not – as would occur with time-based intervals for rebalancing, **a relative threshold to the target weighting** will just trigger rebalancing trades for the exact investment that moves away from the rest.

A 2007 study in the Journal of Financial Planning by Gobind Daryanani entitled “Opportunistic Rebalancing” studied rolling 5-year periods from 1992 to 2004 and found that the optimal rebalancing threshold was at **a relative threshold of 20%** of the investment’s original weighting. 
- Setting the thresholds narrower, such as only 10% or 15% bands, produced less favorable results, as did rebalancing bands that were 25%.
- The goal is to set a threshold that is ‘far enough’ out to allow investments to run near extremes, but not so far that they run to extremes and bounce back again, without ever triggering a buy or sell trade.
