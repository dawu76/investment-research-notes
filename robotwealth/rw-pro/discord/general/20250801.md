## Discord notes from 2025 August

"How do you guys typically handle a factor whose relationship with forward returns is mostly stable (strong correlation), but the sign flips for long periods of time? and i believe the change is a structural non-random change in the relationship. first things that come to mind are:
- identify the root cause of the relationship change, maybe its some condition i didn't account for/model properly and then condition on that
- if i believe its an underlying change in how the market prices the factor, then build some sort of adaptiveness in the signal based on past IC"

In an ideal world, there'd be a clear causal mechanism that you could incorporate into your model. More likely though, the change will only be obvious in hindsight. 
- One thing you can try is to quantify the stickiness of the sign and magnitude of the IC (scatter plot of today's IC vs tomorrow's IC, autocorrelation plot, etc). If it's positive in one period, is it likely to be positive in the next and vice versa. If the answer to that question is yes, then you could do some sort of rolling IC of the raw factor, and use that flip its sign and maybe even scale it - need to be a bit careful with overfitting though. And depending on just how sticky it is, it might not improve things. But worth looking at.

"I remember that @therobotjames alluded to a way of hedging while making money without getting into details. Can we hedge a portfolio using a selling options strategy with controlled risk?"

Euan: No. I really think people should get into the habit of separating edge from hedge. A hedge is a risk control to reduce your exposure to stuff you don't want. If it makes money it is an edge. And it is really cool if your edges are anti-correlated (they almost never will be) but they still aren't hedges. Splitting stuff like this makes what is going on a lot more clear.
Kris: Kris A. wrote an excellent article about this - scroll down about half way, worth a read: "If You Make Money Every Day, Youâ€™re Not Maximizing"

"Would it be stupid to spend time looking around for a silly premia between say IBIT and MSTR etc given NAV seems out of whack? What has existed like this before that would be similar and that we have analysed before if anything, would something from Armageddon trading be relevant?"

Rob Carver wrote a nice piece playing with some premia around MSTR. It had some cool methodology and might be what you are looking for: https://docsend.com/view/fkcwetk5gwk66sz6
- ... Feel like this is more achievable with IBIT or something perhaps.
- ... if it's the vibes coeff and its error margin that gets you paid, you should be doing this on $BMNR and the soon-to-launch Nakamoto and American Bitcoin. with managing slippage, your bias should be skewed to the upside given how good these guys are at collusive grifting.

"If you were estimating weighted average price and you want to use multiple levels instead of just the first level in the book, what would be a good way to weight the price levels further away from the best? the formula for 1 level looks like: WAP = (bid size x ask price + ask size x bid price) / (bid size + ask size). Trying to think of good way to weight further levels of the book inversely proportional to their distance from best."
- You can exponentially decay it. or maybe another way would be to use distance away from best measured in price of underlying as opposed to using level number. not sure which would be better. Depends on tick size.
