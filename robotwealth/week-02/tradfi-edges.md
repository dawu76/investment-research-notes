### Commodity Carry Trade (in the past)

Commodity futures contracts
- sold by commodity producers / suppliers to lock in the prices they can earn for their resources (e.g. oil); sellers of contracts agree to deliver 10,000 barrels of oil
- purchased by commodity users to lock in the prices they pay for the resources (e.g. airlines and logistics firms buying oil); buyers of contracts agree to take delivery of 10,000 barrels of oil

Persistent discount of futures contract price
- the supply of futures contracts sold by producers usually outweighed the demand for those contracts (hedges) by buyers; this supply-demand imbalance caused the futures contract price to be consistently less than the spot price by ~5%, e.g. the spot price might be $20 while the December futures price would be $19
- this futures contract price discount attracted speculators who bought the contract and held it to (almost) expiration in the hopes that the spot and futures price would converge; the expectation was that typically the spot price would remain relatively unchanged while the futures price would rise to converge to the spot price

What role did speculators play? they took on risk in order to earn a positive expected return
- speculators provided a useful service: they provided demand for the futures contracts sold by producers; otherwise producers would not be able to lock in prices for their products, or they would be able to lock in very low prices
- it was not a riskless trade for speculators, as the spot could fall, causing the futures position to either not rise or even fall; on occasion the spot would rise, in which case the futures contract would see a greater than 5% return

Disappearance of this edge
- in the mid-2000s, the futures price started to trade at a premium to spot
- due to an increasing number of speculators and CTA funds trying to take advantage of this edge, the demand for these futures contracts started to outweight the supply, causing the futures price to actually exceed the spot price
