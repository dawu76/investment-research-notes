- There are 2 games being played in the market: 1) an aggressive, short-term arbitrage and relative value game played by HFT firms, 2) a longer-term game played by analysts digging into financial statements and/or macro factors 
- In the first game, aggressive competition among HFT-like firms to take advantage of mis-pricings by less-informed investors leads to those mis-pricings being quickly arbitraged away. E.g. if I try to buy an asset at $150 even though its assumed fair value is $100, trading firms will try to advantage of that by selling to me at above fair value. But if I quote at $150, another firm will likely try to undercut me by quoting a price between $100 and $150. This competition results in me not overpaying as much despite my mis-informed view of pricing.
