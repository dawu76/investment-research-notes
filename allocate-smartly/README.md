### How Allocate Smartly's Tactical Asset Allocation tool works

Combine strategies: combine those strategies with the click of a button to create their own custom Model Portfolios
- strategies are sourced from books, academic papers and other publications
- these strategies are quantitative and systematic, meaning well-defined mathematical rules govern exactly when and what to trade
- analyze each strategy with thorough, up to date backtests
- combine them to create their own custom Model Portfolios to reduce the risk of any single strategy going off the rails and to provide smoother, more consistent investment returns
- assumptions: all strategies trade at the market close (read more about when we trade), and that trades are executed using large, liquid ETFs
- refer to the FAQ for more info on the assets used to replicate each strategy

Follow in near real-time
- follow Model Portfolios in near real-time, and receive an email notification when a change is likely to occur today

- "all of the testing shown above is “walked forward”, meaning at each data point Meta only had access to the data that was available at that point in time. Meta can’t “peek” into the future the way we could if we simply chose the best performing strategies as of today. That provides a certain degree of confidence that our approach is targeting future outperformance, not simply past outperformance."

### On reported backtested results [from FAQ]

"Our results are more pessimistic (realistic) than you’ll find elsewhere because our test assumptions tend to be stricter. Some examples - We account for transaction costs/slippage, which developers often do not. See Backtest Assumptions."

"We represent each asset class using the largest, most liquid ETF in that space. We do not allow for niche or less commonly traded assets for both practical reasons (it makes combining multiple strategies together more manageable), as well as analytical reasons (it’s a guard against overfitting)".

"When simulating historical asset data (read more), we only use indices or other data sources that are closely related to a large, liquid ETF trading today."
