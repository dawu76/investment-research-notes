### Federal Reserve and QE/QT

[Bloomberg](https://archive.ph/Cmxl7): The Fed Is About to Go Full Throttle on QT. Fear Not.
- "By combining the size of the Fed’s balance sheet with the amount of reverse repos outstanding and the TGA balance, we can create a liquidity indicator that better explains movements in stock prices than just the Fed’s balance sheet alone. Stocks have closely tracked the size of the Fed's balance sheet assets minus reverse repos outstanding and the Treasury General Account."
- "the Fed expanded its reverse repo program, which consisted of the Fed delivering high-quality collateral with the promise to buy it back in a certain number of days at a higher price. Reverse repos are a liquidity draining operation, much like QT. They both involve the Fed decreasing the amount of cash in the system by increasing the amount of bonds. Usually, the Fed would only engage in repo operations with primary dealers, but the need to soak up extra liquidity was so great that it widened the list of eligible counter parties to include mutual funds and other non-traditional accounts."
- The Treasury General Account is another Fed operation that affects liquidity. "In the past, when the government issued fixed-income securities and took in taxes, they almost immediately distributed the funds from those endeavors. As a result, the TGA rarely had a balance. In the Covid era, however, there have been times when the TGA has increased to previously unimagined levels, reaching almost $1.8 trillion in mid-2020. Increases in the TGA have the same effect as QT. Bonds are issued and cash withdrawn from the financial system, but the money is not distributed into the economy. It is a liquidity draining operation."

[Bloomberg](https://archive.ph/nL01X): What the Fed's QT Means for That $2 Trillion Pile of Cash
- "Over the last two years, it bought roughly $4.6 trillion of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities through quantitative easing to keep longer-term interest rates low and stimulate the economy. Yet the process, also known as QE, created a wall of money that needed to get deposited somewhere, leading to ballooning bank reserves."
- The Fed’s facility for overnight reverse repurchase agreements lets money funds park up to $160 billion apiece and earn 0.80%, more than about 0.70% for a one-month Treasury bill.
- "QT will reduce the supply of reserves, as the Fed plans to roll over some of the bonds on its balance sheet at maturity [allow them to "roll off"?] without replacing it with other assets. If the amount of coupon-bearing debt maturing is less than that, it can fill the gap by not replacing some of its bills too.
The government will then "pay" back the maturing bond by subtracting the sum from the cash balance Treasury keeps on deposit with the Fed - effectively making the money disappear."

- "QE is when the Fed and other central banks are buying government bonds — but not directly from the Treasury Department. They’re buying government bonds from banks and paying for them with central bank reserves."

[Medium](https://medium.com/@joshuafkon/a-primer-on-quantitative-easing-qe-and-its-inherent-limits-391a0c2a3cbc): A Primer on Quantitative Easing (QE) and Its Inherent Limits
- "QE is neutral to the monetary base and does not remove government liabilities -although it does lower debt-servicing costs." Per Bernanke: "sometimes you hear the Fed is printing money, that’s not really happening, the amount of cash in circulation is not changing. What’s happening is that banks are holding more and more reserves with the Fed."
- What happens with QE is that "the Federal Reserve and other central banks are buying government bonds — but not directly from the Treasury Department. They’re buying government bonds from banks and paying for them with central bank reserves."
- "Crucially, these cash reserves are held by the central bank and pay an interest rate just as the treasury bonds did. In a sense the Federal Reserve swapped ten year treasury bonds with hypothetical _Federal Reserve Bonds_. That’s why you can see a graph of the money supply that shows a massive increase, and yet inflation has not spiked. The money never entered the economy — it is being held in a vault at the central bank (or more realistically is just a number in a spreadsheet). In practical terms it was an asset swap, not a true increase in the money supply."

Question: What are Treasury bills vs. Treasury bonds?
- Treasury bonds, Treasury bills, and Treasury notes are all government-issued fixed income securities that are deemed safe and secure. These investments are auctioned off regularly on the U.S. Treasury's website; TreasuryDirect.
- T-bonds mature in 20 or 30 years and offer the highest interest payments bi-annually.
- T-notes mature anywhere between two and 10 years, with bi-annual interest payments, but lower yields.
- T-bills have the shortest maturity terms—from four weeks to one year.

### Overnight reverse repo facility

[bpi.com](https://bpi.com/the-reverse-repo-bank/): The Reverse Repo Bank
- "The Federal Reserve introduced the overnight reverse repo facility (ON RRP) in 2014 to improve its control of the federal funds rate. The set of counterparties eligible to participate in the ON RRP is quite broad and includes banks, MMFs, government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) and primary dealers. MMFs and the GSEs have accounted for almost all ON RRP take-up."
- "The ON RRP facility helps the Federal Reserve set a floor on the fed funds rate because the Fed controls the interest rate that MMFs and GSEs earn on their excess holdings of cash. More precisely, by setting the ON RRP rate close or equal to the lower bound of the federal funds rate target range, the Fed effectively sets a hard floor (at least, to date) for the policy rate. "
- "Capital requirements of banks have been significantly increasing over the past 2 years, with both leverage and risk-based requirements rising about 25 percent. Given these balance sheet pressures, it is not surprising that money market funds have been absorbing some of the excess deposits at banks and are investing those funds in the ON RRP facility. We estimate that the $2.2 trillion in RRP balances is currently saving the largest banks $50 billion in tier 1 capital. "

### US Banking System Failures

[FDIC paper](https://www.fdic.gov/bank/historical/history/): An Examination of the Banking Crises of the 1980s and Early 1990s
- The distinguishing feature of the history of banking in the 1980s was the extraordinary upsurge in the number of bank failures. Between 1980 and 1994 more than 1,600 banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) were closed or received FDIC financial assistancefar more than in any other period since the advent of federal deposit insurance in the 1930s 
- The behavior of banks in the regions and sectors that suffered recessions during the 1980s also exhibited some common elements:
  - In the economic expansions that preceded these recessions, banks generally responded aggressively to rising credit demands.
  - Banks that failed during the regional recessions generally had assumed greater risks, on average, than those that survived, as measured by ratios of total loans and commercial real estate loans to total assets. Banks that failed had generally not been in a seriously weak condition (as measured by equity-to-assets ratios) in the years preceding the regional recessions.
  - Banks chartered in the 1980s and mutual institutions converting to the stock form of ownership failed with greater frequency than comparable banks
