### Home office depreciation

How was this calculated?

There are two ways your home office expenses could have been calculated, depending on which method you chose, the simplified deduction or actual expenses.

If you chose the simplified method:

The deduction is calculated based on the square footage of your home office.
The current calculation is $5 per square foot of your home office. If your home office is 100 square feet, you’d get a $500 deduction when used as a home office for 12 months.
You're limited to a maximum of 300 square feet of office space per business owner. Your office space may be bigger than that, but the deduction is based on no more than 300 square feet.
The simplified home office deduction can’t exceed $1,500.
If you chose the actual method:

The deduction is calculated using the actual expenses you had for your home office, like utilities, rent, property taxes, depreciation of the home, and carryover losses.
You have to have records and receipts of your home office expenses.
Any home office expenses that were unallowed in a prior year can be taken when you choose the actual method.

- "all your business income, 1/2 self-employment tax, contributions to retirement plans, and health insurance is itemized separately on Schedule 1 rather than just reporting your total net income amount in line 3 Schedule 1. This is the way the IRS categorizes this type of reporting ..."
- clarification: "employer contributions to a solo 401(k) are not deductible on Schedule C.  They only go on Schedule 1 line 16 as part of the self-employed retirement deduction, which you indicated.  Only employer contributions for non-owner employees are deductible on Schedule C, and a solo 401(k) is not permitted to have non-owner participants .... it is an adjustment to income on Schedule 1 line 16 which goes to 1040 line 10. That is for both the [employ-] EE & ER contributions.  No, it is not new."
- '... This has never changed.  The sole proprietor gets the deduction on Schedule 1 line 16 for both the employee elective deferrals and the employer contribution to the sole proprietor's 401(k) account.

[Elevation Financial](https://www.elevationfinancial.com/solo-401-k-contributions-employee-vs-employer): EmployEE vs EmployER contributions to solo 401K
- Employee contributions: These contributions can be made with pre-tax dollars, meaning they're deducted from your income before taxes are calculated. This can significantly reduce your taxable income for the year, potentially lowering your overall tax bill. For example, if you earn $100,000 and contribute $20,000 to your Solo 401(k) as an employee, your taxable income would be reduced to $80,000. But if you have multiple jobs or participate in other employer-sponsored retirement plans, your total employee contributions across all plans cannot exceed the annual limit.
- Employer contributions: You can contribute up to 25% of your compensation as an employer (this would be your salary if you are taxed as an S-corp). However, if you're a sole proprietor or single-member LLC, the calculation is slightly different - it's 20% of your net self-employment income. This is because the contribution itself is tax-deductible, which reduces the effective percentage. It's important to note that these employer contributions are in addition to your employee contributions. These contributions are considered a business expense, which means they can be deducted from your business's taxable income. This can result in substantial tax savings, especially for high-earning self-employed individuals.

- You sometimes might see that the employer contribution is limited to 25% of the employee compensation, which is a different way to word the employer limit, but it's actually the same amount as saying 20% of the net profit of the business. You get the same number either way.
- For example: Net profit = $100K, 20% of $100k = $20k contributed to the solo 401k as the employer. Or if we subtract the employer contribution from the net profit, we get $100k - $20K = $80k. 25% of $80K = $20K, which is equal to the 20% of the net income after subtracting the employer contribution.

- Net Self-Employment Income after Business Expenses ($100,000)
- 1/2 of Self Employment Tax ($14,129.55/2 = $7,064.78) = Net Adjusted Business Profit ($92,935.23)
- From here, we can determine your maximum profit-sharing contribution alongside your maximum employee contributions. 
- 2025 Maximum Employee Contribution Amount (for those age 50 or over): $31,000
- Maximum Profit-Sharing Contribution is up to 20% of net adjusted business profit: $18,587 (20% * $92,935.23) - Total contribution amount: $49,587

Qualified Business Income deduction

Congrats, you get a tax break. You get the Qualified Business Income deduction.
- You just got a $7,611 deduction. This amount is based on the latest IRS guidance.

The Qualified Business Income (QBI) deduction is based on the industry you work in and how much money you made.
- Taxpayers that qualify for QBI can deduct 20% of their net self-employed income or 20% of their taxable income, whichever is lower. However, there are limits to how much you can deduct, depending on which industry you work in and how much money you made.
- You automatically qualify for this deduction if you made $191,950 (single) or $383,900 (joint) or less in taxable income.
- However, there are limits to how much you can deduct if your income is higher than the amounts listed previously and you work in a specific industry (listed below).

### Standard vs. itemized deduction

Based on what you just told us: Standard Deduction is right for you. Since the Standard Deduction is a larger amount than your itemized deductions, it’ll lower your taxable income more and get you a bigger tax break.

Itemized deduction: $27,716
- Property, state, and local tax deduction (limited to $10,000)	$10,000.00
- All Deductible Interest: $17,716.00

Standard deduction: $29,000
- Tax due with this deduction: $5,871

The Standard Deduction is a fixed dollar amount set by the government that is based on things like your filing status and age.

Your itemized deductions would be the total of all of your individual deductions. These include things like:
- Car registration fees
- Mortgage interest
- Donations to charity
- Medical expenses
- Real estate taxes
- Personal property tax
- State income tax withholding or sales tax

Your standard deduction depends on your filing status and age. Here's what you can expect:
- Single: $14,600
- Head of Household: $21,900
- Married Filing Jointly: $29,200
- Married Filing Separately: $14,600
- Qualifying Surviving Spouse: $29,200
- You can get a higher Standard Deduction amount if you're legally blind, or if you are age 65 or older.

### Q&A

**Question**: suppose someone owes $10,000 in self-employment taxes to the IRS. is it possible for someone to have to pay that self-employment tax while at the same time be eligible for a refund on income tax through other credits / deductions?

Response from Claude 3.7 Sonnet

> Yes, this is absolutely possible. Self-employment taxes and income taxes are calculated separately on your tax return, and it's entirely possible to owe money for one while receiving a refund for the other.
Here's how this can happen:

Separate calculations:
- Self-employment tax (15.3% covering Social Security and Medicare) is calculated on Schedule SE based on your net self-employment earnings, regardless of other deductions or credits.

Income tax calculation: Your income tax is calculated separately after accounting for all deductions and credits, which could include:
- Business expense deductions
- Retirement contributions (IRA, Solo 401(k))
- Standard or itemized deductions
- Child tax credits
- Education credits
- Earned Income Tax Credit
- Stimulus credits

Final tax bill: When you file your return, these calculations are combined:

If your withholdings/estimated tax payments exceed your total tax liability (self-employment tax + income tax - credits), you get a refund. If they're less, you owe the difference.

For example, someone might have:
- $10,000 in self-employment tax
- $3,000 in income tax before credits
- $5,000 in refundable tax credits
- $9,000 in withholdings/estimated payments

Final calculation: $10,000 + $3,000 - $5,000 = $8,000 total tax due
- With $9,000 already paid, they would receive a $1,000 refund despite owing self-employment tax.
- This scenario is particularly common for self-employed people with children who qualify for refundable credits like the Child Tax Credit or Earned Income Credit.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.

**Question**: if i am self-employed, do my contributions to my personal IRA as well as solo 401K accounts reduce my tax bill for the year?

Response from Claude 3.7 Sonnet

> Yes, if you're self-employed, contributions to both a personal IRA and a Solo 401(k) can reduce your tax bill for the year, though they affect different parts of your taxes:

Solo 401(k) Contributions:
- Employer contributions (as your own employer) reduce your self-employment income, which lowers both your income tax and self-employment tax
- Employee contributions (as your own employee) reduce your income tax but not your self-employment tax
- For 2024, you can contribute up to $23,000 as an employee, plus an additional $7,500 if you're 50 or older
- As an employer, you can contribute up to 25% of your net self-employment income

Traditional IRA Contributions reduce your income tax but not your self-employment tax
- For 2024, you can contribute up to $7,000 ($8,000 if you're 50 or older)
- Deductibility may be limited if you or your spouse have a retirement plan at work and your income exceeds certain thresholds

Important Notes:
- You can contribute to both a Solo 401(k) and an IRA in the same year
- The tax benefits apply to traditional accounts, not Roth versions (which provide tax-free growth instead of immediate tax deductions)
- There are specific timing requirements for establishing and funding these accounts to count for the current tax year
- These retirement contributions can significantly reduce your overall tax bill while simultaneously building your retirement savings.
