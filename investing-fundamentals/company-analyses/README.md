[Seeking Alpha: Cavanaugh Research](https://archive.is/41yF0): Meta's Q4 Earnings Preview: What You Need To Know
- Assuming the average analyst consensus estimate as a benchmark, it is suggested that Meta's Q4 sales may decrease by around 6.1% compared to the same quarter in 2021. Additionally, analysts have provided EPS estimates ranging from $1.41 to $2.66, with an average of $2.21, which would indicate a year-over-year decline of almost 40%!
- One potential source for upside could be anchored on a recovery in digital advertising. Investors should consider that macro conditions, or at least sentiment and expectations, have materially improved in Q4 2022 as compared to Q3 2022 - with leading banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) now expecting a softish landing. Notably, going into Q2 and Q3 reporting, some advertising players, notably Snap Inc. (SNAP) warned investors about the deteriorating advertising environment. But we have not heard any such warning from any player going into Q4. Investors should also not fail to disregard implications from the China reopening on advertising - as a bullish macro driver for the global economy.
- Martin Sorrell's comments: "I think that is the big thing here [the reopening of China]. And remember... Alphabet/ Google, Amazon, Meta, there second biggest profit centers have historically been outbound Chinese -- Chinese companies targeting business abroad."
- According to Meta's projections, the negative impact of foreign currency on year-over-year total revenue growth in the fourth quarter was estimated to be around 7%, based on current exchange rates at the time of guidance. Since then, however, the U.S. Dollar Index has depreciated materially - by almost 8%!

- Big themes
  - Major milestone on Facebook: 2 billion daily actives — the highest it’s ever been.
  - Our focus this year: artificial intelligence, messaging, creators and monetization.
- AI-Powered Discovery
  - We’re using AI to recommend all types of content beyond Reels: photos, text, groups, short- and long-form videos and more. This is a massive technological undertaking. AI-powered recommendations are delivered and refined in response to people’s direct feedback through tools like our Show More or Show Less feature
  - Using AI to find public Group content based on your interests: we can now show you highly relevant content from public Groups in your Feed without you having to do any searching or depending on word of mouth to uncover a Group.
  - We use AI to identify creators who may appeal to your interests and to improve how we recommend Reels and other great content from creators in your Feed. More than 140 billion Reels are played across Facebook and Instagram each day.
- Creators and Monetization
  - We’re heavily invested in building tools for creators. We’ve been working to simplify the Facebook experience for creators, rolling out more formats for creative expression, providing tools to help grow and manage fan communities, and expanding ways to earn income as a creator on Facebook.
  - We're focused on adapting and enhancing our monetization tools for short-form video. We’ll continue expanding our ads on Facebook Reels tests to help more creators earn ad revenue for their Reels and grow virtual gifting via Stars on Reels.
- Messaging
  - Over 140 billion messages are sent across our apps every day. On Instagram, people already reshare Reels nearly 1 billion times daily through DMs and on Facebook we see private sharing of Reels growing strongly as well.
  - We started introducing community chats to some Facebook Groups last year as a way for people to connect more deeply with their online communities in real time. Across Facebook and Messenger, we saw the number of people trying community chats increase by 50% in December 2022.
