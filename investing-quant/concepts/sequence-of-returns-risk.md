### Sequence of return risk

[kitces.com](https://www.kitces.com/blog/url-upside-potential-sequence-of-return-risk-in-retirement-median-final-wealth/): The Extraordinary Upside Potential Of Sequence Of Return Risk In Retirement [2019]

Key message: Watch out for asymmetric sequence risk to the **upside**, which can cause you to lose out on enjoying your assets while you're alive. To avoid this, use a '**ratcheting**' rule, where spending is ratcheted higher if/when/as a favorable sequence occurs.

- "A bad sequence of returns coupled with ongoing withdrawals can catastrophically deplete a portfolio too quickly. [But] a **good** sequence of returns can quickly compound the portfolio so far ahead that substantial excess wealth accrues instead. Because of how long-term returns compound to the upside, favorable sequences of returns actually produce **far more excess wealth** than unfavorable sequences risk to the downside.

- For instance, taking a 4% initial withdrawal rate has an equal (10%) likelihood of leaving all the retiree’s principal left over at the end of retirement ... or leaving 6X the starting account balance remaining instead.

- The asymmetric nature of sequence risk to the upside suggests that simply spending conservatively and adjusting later if a “good” surprise occurs may be too likely to leave dramatic levels of unspent wealth that could have been enjoyed earlier.

- Advice: "at minimum, aim to have a ratcheting plan to lift a low initial spending rate higher if the sequence is favorable (or at least, is not unfavorable)." Even better, _"set guardrails in advance to know both when to cut spending in a bad sequence, and when to lift it higher in a more favorable one."_

Why is this possible?

- The long-term return on an annually rebalancing 60/40 portfolio of simply large-cap US stocks and intermediate government bonds is upwards of 8% since the 1920s. Even after 30 years of inflation, the bulk of the principal would still be left over if taking a 6% initial withdrawal rate against a portfolio with an 8% long-term return ... even if we look at the **worst** 30-year returns for a balanced portfolio – a 6.28% CAGR for an investor starting in 1929 – an investor could still sustain an initial withdrawal rate of almost 5.4% and only barely run out of money at the end of the 30th year.

- **Big caveat**: in practice, those withdrawal rates have a remarkably high risk of failure, i.e. run out of money in an unacceptably high % of simulated scenarios. E.g. taking even 'just' a 5% initial withdrawal rate (and adjusting spending for inflation in each subsequent year) actually runs out of money in **nearly 25% of historical scenarios**. To survive all the potential bad sequences that have occurred in history, it’s necessary to take out **'just' 4%** of the initial account balance (adjusting the spending in subsequent years for inflation). This is where the 4% withdrawl rule comes from.

- Interesting fact that emphasizes the importance of sequence risk: There is remarkably little connection between the 30-year return of the 60/40 rebalanced portfolio, and the sustainable initial withdrawal rate itself. Why? Because the sustainability of portfolio withdrawals is driven far more by the **sequence** of returns that occur, than the actual long-term return itself. The fact that an unfavorable sequence of returns _could_ happen means that the retiree _must withdraw far less, "just in case."_ Thus the evolution of the 4% safe withdrawal rate (low enough to have worked in 100% of available historical scenarios).

- But withdrawing just 4% each year, adjusted for inflation each year, on average a 4% initial withdrawal rate results in the retiree finishing with nearly triple the original principal, on top of sustaining an initial withdrawal rate of 4% adjusted annually for inflation! **Key point**: dialing down spending to manage sequence of return risk – a la the traditional 4% rule as a means to “avoid running out” of money – almost always produces excess wealth, and in favorable sequences can produce dramatic levels of “excess” wealth. One solution to this issue: use a '**ratcheting**' rule, where spending is ratcheted higher if/when/as a favorable sequence occurs.

A simple ratchet-style approach, where spending is increased by 10% any time the portfolio rises **more than 50% abov**e its starting value, can “dominate” the traditional 4% rule, generating equivalent or better retirement spending in all scenarios, even while being conservative enough to not require a spending cut in the event of a market pullback in the future.
