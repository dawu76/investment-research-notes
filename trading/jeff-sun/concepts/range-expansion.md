## ADR%: Trend-Following vs. Range-Expansive Move Behavior [[tweet](https://x.com/jfsrev/status/1852994791795282188)]

I wish to use this post to clarify in case anyone misinterprets how to apply the ADR% filter in their screening criteria.

Here’s an overlay of the historical ADR% indicator highlighting two types of +70% upward moves within the same quarter. I’ve selected four stocks with varying prices, share structures, sector/group, floats, and trading volumes. 

$EAT and $GEV show a trend-following, yet volatility-compressive move (ADR% compression) during its +70% run, similar to $CAVA and $APP, which also demonstrated volatility compression.
- Note the ADRs near 3% and the 45 to 56 trading days (2-3 months) needed for +70% moves.

$EAT - Restaurants  
- Market Cap: $4.4B  
- Share Float: 43M  
- Average $ Volume (50D): $135M  
- Average Share Volume (50D): 1.3M  
- ADR%: 3.1%  
- Time to +70%: 45 trading days  

$GEV - Electronics Products  
- Market Cap: $83B
- Share Float: 274M  
- Average $ Volume (50D): $843M  
- Average Share Volume (50D): 2.8M  
- ADR%: 2.99%  
- Time to +70%: 56 trading days

$OKLO and $WULF exhibit a broad, range-expansive price movement, with high ADR% volatility throughout their upward trajectory. Very much like short term momentum burst advocated by @PradeepBonde.
- Note that 10% to 18% ADR% and the very short periods (4 to 10 trading days) needed for +70% moves.
- These companies also have much smaller sub-$3B market caps.
 
$OKLO - Sector: Industrial Machinery  
- Market Cap: $2.6B  
- Share Float: 69M  
- Average $ Volume (50D): $276M  
- Average Share Volume (50D): 12M  
- ADR%: 18%  
- Time to +70%: 4 trading days  

$WULF - Sector: Data Processing Services 
- Market Cap: $2.3B  
- Share Float: 274M  
- Average $ Volume (50D): $138M  
- Average Share Volume (50D): 22M  
- ADR%: 10%  
- Time to +70%: 8-10 trading days

This comparison could provide valuable insights into the type of trading you may want to prioritize, allowing you to optimize your screener to align better with your trading style. Additionally different execution parameters and rule, exit or profit-taking strategies may be necessary to adapt to the distinct price movement patterns shown here.

> There are two types of stock moves - magnitude moves and duration moves. Select which one you want to trade. Then, you will have a lot of clarity.
> - Magnitude moves are moves where a stock makes a very big move quickly. The magnitude and speed of the move are critical in this kind of move.
> - Duration moves are when stock keeps going up for a long time. But speed may be a little slow.
> 
> Traders thrive on magnitude and speed moves. By capturing hundreds of small timeframe magnitude moves, traders can grow accounts rapidly.
>
> Investors are looking for duration moves. Duration moves do not require frequent trading and can be bought and left to grow. So, duration moves in individual stocks can last for years, and investors who sit through those moves benefit. Duration moves are also more tax-efficient.
>
> Magnitude moves and duration moves need different approaches to finding and trading. The criteria that might lead to magnitude moves are often very short-term. Duration moves require different scanning and identification approaches. They require a higher skill.

@PradeepBonde highlighted a crucial distinction between two types of stock movements, providing valuable insights to laser-focus your own stock selection, even within a breakout strategy. I personally categorize one as a range-expansive momentum move (e.g., $COIN on 20/11), while the other is identified as a trend-following move (illustrated well by $VRT).

Focus on short-term range expansion via executing trades that are trading at high relative volume beyond pivotal levels.

1. Direct your attention to stocks in these five sectors: $XLK, $XLY, $XLI, $XLE, $XLV. They have the highest success rate of breakouts. I wrote about this with reference to @florinlazar001 research 1-2 years ago.

2. Give preference to lower-priced, lower float, lower capitalization stocks, and those with high short interest, as they often undergo substantial magnitude moves. 

3. Steer clear of executing short-duration setups that **surpass 4x ATR multiples** from their 50-MA. The only **exception** to this rule is for stocks with a **market cap below $500 million**, where I would still set not trade them at more than a 5x multiple.

4. Setups should encompass **range compression** coupled with **volume contraction**, likened to a compressed coil spring.

5. Execute trades only on setups securing pivotal levels _below 100% ATR from the current Low of the Day (LoD)_. This significantly heightens the probability of concluding the day with unrealized profits based on historical IV, implied volatility.

6. Execute trades that secure pivotal levels with _substantial volume relative to its average 50-MA volume_, contingent on the time period of the day (e.g., 40% relative vol to 50-MA vol in the first 30 minutes is a substantial liquidity event). If you have a watchlist stock trading beyond 10% dollar volume to their market cap, they should be your priority (look at how $CVNA started the +600% run in 2023)

7. Refrain from entering if stop losses require pricing and sizing beyond 1 ATR below your entry. This ensures optimal exploitation of a winning trade in terms of profit factor and risk-reward ratio. 

8. If your thesis isn't validated upon entry, reduce your position size before it even reaches your stop. If you are not proven right, you are yet to be proven wrong either. By controlling and improving losses below 1.0R, 0.8R, and 0.6R per losing trade, you can go a long way. Imagine the capability of a 5R winner covering 9 losses, instead of 5. 

9. Don't dismiss leveraged ETFs as trading ideas; they can exhibit much larger range-expansive moves than individual stocks within the same sector or group. Now I'm stalking etfs like $KOLD $DRIP $TZA $DPST.

I genuinely believe that these rules hold merit and can enhance your profitability.
