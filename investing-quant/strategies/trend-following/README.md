### CTA vs. Global Macro

Global macro strategy definitions
- This is a flexible strategy whose positions are based on views regarding the economic and geopolitical prospects of various countries. These views are informed by interest rates, politics, domestic and foreign poilcies, international trade, currency exchange rates, etc.
- Holdings may include long and short positions in various equity, fixed income, currency, commodities, and futures markets. The funds may take directional or relative value bets.

3 primary types of global macro funds
- discretionary global macro: in these funds, the PMs take a high-level view of global markets and allocate funds to asset classes accordingly in a flexible, discretionary manner
- CTAS: these funds rely primarily on trend-following algorithms to go long or short different assets (commodities, currencies, etc.)
- systematic global macro: these funds blend a discretionary and CTA-based approach
