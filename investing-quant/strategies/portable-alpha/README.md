### Portable alpha

Definition from Pimco:

> "Portable alpha is an investment approach that provides target market exposure, while adding the potential for additional return (alpha) through a separate investment strategy. Because the source of alpha is independent of the desired market exposure, it can theoretically be transported to any market exposure, hence the term 'portable alpha.'"

Implementation per Pimco
- Get market exposure via market-linked instruments such as futures or swaps. Due to leverage, these positions require only a small outlay of cash (if any), allowing the manager to both capture the market return and actively manage the bulk of the portfolio’s cash in a liquid strategy.
- This liquid strategy can be an absolute return bond alpha strategy, for example, that can provide additional return.
- As with an auto loan or mortgage, there is a financing cost associated with buying market exposure using futures or swaps. This cost is usually tied to a short-term money market rate. The alpha strategy must outperform this money market rate in order to deliver excess return.
- At PIMCO, we typically back our portable alpha portfolios with actively managed, high quality liquid enhanced cash, absolute return bonds, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) or long-duration bond strategies.

Implementation per Blackrock: There are three key steps to implement a portable alpha strategy.
- First, the investor chooses a target index for their beta exposure.
- Second, the target index is replicated using market-linked instruments. This part of the portfolio requires a small amount of cash in the form of a margin requirement to achieve the exposure, but also comes with a cash financing cost. As a result, there is excess cash to allocate capital.
- The final step is to invest the remaining funds in an alpha source and a cash reserve.

Example per Blackrock
- Get 100% of target index exposure using market-linked instruments at financing cost of 1.0%.
- 40% of the index exposure is backed by physical cash = 20% margin and 20% reserve). Reinvest this cash at a cash rate matching financing cost rate. So we pay for the remaining 60% of exposure. Cost of target index exposure = 1% - 0.4%0 (from reinvestment) = 0.6% financing cost.
- Take this 60% of the overall portfolio and invest with an alpha-seeking manager. If alpha-seeking manager targeted a 5% return, then our 60% exposure to it would yield 3%.
- Overall expected return = expected return of target index + additional 3% from alpha source - 0.6% cash financing cost = expected return of target index + 2.4%

Comparison based on historical data
- Alpha generated by top-quartile of US Large Cap Core equity manager: realized 10-year annualized alpha of a top-quartile manager = 0.58%
- Compare this to portable alpha that replicates S&P 500 Index through market-linked instruments + 60% allocation to alternative strategy
- Represent this alt strategy by the HFRI 500 Equity Market Neutral Index
- 60% of HFRI 500 Equity Market Neutral Index = 0.60 * 3.22% = 1.93%
- Subtract financing cost of market beta exposure, as measured by ICE BofA 3-Month Treasury Bill Index: 60% * 0.63%
- Remaining alpha = 1.55%

But what happens if 3-month T-bill is 4.8%, as it is now? Financing cost of market exposure = 60% of 4.8% = 2.88%. Does that outweight the gross alpha from the 60% exposure to an alt strategy of 60% * 3.22%? 

Overall return
- Determined by how much capital is allocated to the alpha source, how much return it generates, the return of the index exposure, and the cost to finance the index exposure

Advantages
- Investors can enhance their portfolios’ return potential without making dramatic alterations to a traditional asset allocation model. They can get full exposure to market beta and then add returns on top of it through the remaining cash.
- The portfolio’s active risk budget is separated from its beta allocation. Portfolio capital is freed up to earb excess returns from markets with highest alpha potential.
- Because the cash is invested differently than the target market exposure, investors may gain a diversification advantage, helping to manage portfolio risk.

Side note from Blackrock re: fixed income manager's 'reach for yield'
- "To combat the low yield environment, many fixed income managers have resorted to “reach for yield” behavior—essentially going further and further down the credit quality spectrum to seek out extra yield to boost returns."
- Bond manager excess returns are largely explained by tilts to credit risk. Problem: The credit overweight may boost returns in up markets, but may also result in larger fixed income drawdowns in periods of equity sell-offs - when investors need the diversification of core bonds the most.
- Higher-risk credit is more correlated with equities and thus does not benefit from a 'flight to safety' return that US government bonds offer.

Case study: PSLDX from Seeking Alpha article, "PSLDX One Year Later: The Right Idea At The Wrong Time"
- "PSLDX has a lot of duration (about 16 years), so some investors inadvertently took on too much interest rate risk with funds like PSLDX and took a beating from it."
- I made a 100% stock/100% bond benchmark and compared it to PSLDX in Portfolio Visualizer. The point of this is that it would detect if any weird bets led to PSLDX's poor performance this year, or if the market was driving it. What I found was that from the peak in November to month-end October, PSLDX beat its benchmark by about 200 bps. Granted, the 100/100 benchmark was down 45% and PSLDX was down 43%, but it shows that the managers of PSLDX are fulfilling their mandate.
- "Asset prices have come down substantially, and they may come down a lot more. When this happens, buyers of PSLDX will find redemption with stocks cheap and bond yields normalized, likely making back the 2022 drawdown over time and then some. Look for the S&P 500 around 3200 and yields of 4.5% or higher on the 30-year Treasury for a highly attractive entry point on PSLDX."
