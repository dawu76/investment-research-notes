- The paper begins by discussing the three sources of Alpha; superior information, processing ability, and behaviour.
- > "If today’s stock price is based on the market’s expectation regarding the future, then in order to predict tomorrow’s stock price change, one must have better expectations about the future than the market. In this sense, the mother of all alphas is the ability to form expectations that are better than the market’s expectations. Consequently, for an active investment manager to claim that he can generate above normal returns (a positive alpha) in the future, he must argue that, in some manner, his expectations regarding the future are better than the market’s expectations."

[paper (2014)](https://business.columbia.edu/sites/default/files-efs/pubfiles/18184/Penman_value_trap.pdf): The Value Trap: Value Buys Risky Growth [source: [InvestmentTalk](https://investmenttalk.substack.com/p/playing-long-games-the-value-trap)]
- Bargain stocks do not exist in a vacuum. They are always surrounded by high doubt and great fear. It is the inflicting pain of the relentless stock price decline in combination with temporary operational issues that creates them. Seeing "Value Traps" that do not exist is a common error among value investors. In a strange habit they call out "Value Traps" in bargain stocks with temporary, albeit often prolonged, operational and stock price weakness, unable to envision that the underlying profit potentials are often largely unimpaired

[Macro-ops post](): What I Learned From Michael Burry's Value Investor Club Write-ups [source: [InvestmentTalk](https://investmenttalk.substack.com/p/playing-long-games-the-value-trap)]
- Michael Burry shared a series of write-ups (here) between 2000 and 2002 on Value Investor’s Club (VIC). In typical Burry style, each is short and to the point, concluding with a brief synopsis of the catalyst. The folks over at MacroOps Musings wrote a great article summarising the overlapping themes of the stock pitches. The TLDR is that Burry liked absolute valuation, downside protection, small and illiquid companies, low share counts, and no restrictions for where he hunted.

[Jensen Investments](https://www.jenseninvestment.com/insights/earnings-adjustments/): Do Not Be Fooled by Earnings Adjustments - Focus on Cash Flow
- Examples of adjustments: excluding amortization related to large M&A and/or intangible assets
- Why are non-GAAP earnings ever reported? They may improve income statement comparability across time periods and between different companies. To aid comparability, non-GAAP excludes one-time expenses such as restructuring costs, goodwill write-downs, and legal expenses.
- GAAP standards require accrual accounting (rather than cash accounting) because it presents a more accurate picture of a company’s financial condition. Under accrual reporting, revenue and expenses are recognized as they occur, while under cash reporting, revenue and expenses are recognized only when the cash changes hands.
- Changes to these adjustments in the non-GAAP earnings do NOT affect cash flow, since amortization is a non-cash expense.

[Jensen Investments](https://www.jenseninvestment.com/insights/access-white-paper-roe/): Return on Equity:
A Compelling Case for Investors
- The goal is to find high-quality, profitable companies that can generate returns above their costs of capital in a variety of circumstances and economic environment.
- We use a time period of 10 consecutive years to calculate ROE and a hurdle rate of 15% per year.

[Alpha Architect](https://alphaarchitect.com/2023/03/research-and-development/): Research and Development, Expected Profitability, and Expected Returns
- Among the various models that try to explain the cross-section of stock returns, an anomaly for all models is the empirical evidence that stocks with high research and development (R&D) expenses have delivered a premium.
- Findings in recent papers
  - There are economically significant increases in average returns to portfolios sorted on R&D expenditures.
  - The R&D effect is not concentrated in either smaller or larger firms.
  - The R&D anomaly cannot be explained by existing asset pricing models, including the relatively recent investment and profitability factors.
  - R&D-intensive firms are associated with: higher future operating performance, return volatility, and default likelihood, i.e. it is closely related to risk-bearing.  This conflicts with a mispricing (behavioral) story: Investors underappreciate the value of R&D, resulting in low prices and high future (realized) returns.
- Findings from a 2023 paper by Goyal, _"R&D, Expected Profitability, and Expected Returns,"_ in which they examined asset pricing implications of corporate R&D expenditures. Their main conclusion: include cash operating profitability as a factor.
  - Adjusting for industry, high R&D firms had positive loadings on a _cash-based operating profitability factor_ and zero alphas.
  - Current R&D expenditures forecasted future firm-level profitability at least three years and sometimes ten years into the future, establishing the channel by which R&D should show up in asset prices—expectations of future profitability. The evidence that R&D forecasted future profitability was even stronger in large stocks.
  - The original versions of the five-factor and q-pricing models were unable to price for R&D expenditures, mainly because their profitability factors did not account for **accruals** [see below]. However, using "cash-based operating profitability" [which excludes accruals] improves the models.
  - Under this suggested model, it's unnecessary to capitalize R&D to reflect intangible investment in book values.
- This ties into research into the explanatory power of intangibles on stock returns, as not accounting for intangibles affects not just value metrics but other measures (e.g., profitability) that often scale by book value or total assets.
  - Research has investigated ways to improve upon the traditional use of the high-minus-low (HML) factor to build a value portfolio. Some funds use multiple value metrics (such as P/E, P/CF, P/S and EBITDA/EV), some of which indirectly provide exposure to the profitability factor. Another approach is to add other factors into the definition of the eligible universe; e.g. since 2013 Dimensional has included a sort for profitability in their value funds. Another approach is to add back to book value an estimate of the value of intangible R&D and organizational expenses.
  - Adjusting for intangibles can result in a large operating profit margin expansion for companies that are intangible-intensive, and insignificant changes for ones that are tangible-intensive.
- Related research on accruals finds that "cash-based profitability" is a better predictor of stock prices than the standard "gross profitability" measure
  - Definitions of company profitability can include or exclude "accruals", which are a non-cash earnings component. Accruals are adjustments to cash flows that can result in a measure of profit largely unaffected by the timing of receipts and payments of cash.
  - Prior research pointed to an "accrual" anomaly, where adding an 'accruals' term better explained future returns relative to a model that simply used gross profitability as a factor. But if firms are sorted based on cash-based operating profitability, an additional screen using accruals adds no predictive value.
  - From the abstract of a 2015 [paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2587199), "Accruals, Cash Flows, and Operating Profitability in the Cross Section of Stock Returns", exploring this: _Prior research finds that expected returns increase in firm profitability. However, firms with high accruals generate lower returns than firms with low accruals, and this “accrual anomaly” strengthens when evaluated using asset pricing models that include a profitability factor. We show that a cash-based operating profitability measure (that excludes accruals) outperforms other measures of profitability (that include accruals) and subsumes accruals in predicting the cross section of average returns. An investor can increase a strategy's Sharpe ratio more by adding just a cash-based operating profitability factor to the investment opportunity set than by adding both an accruals factor and a profitability factor that includes accruals._
