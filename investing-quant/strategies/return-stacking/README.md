### Strategy: return-stacked 60/40 absolute return index

Goals
- Aims to provide exposure to a U.S. 60% equity, 40% bond allocation while stacking diversifying alternative exposures, including tail protection, on top
- Stacking is achieved by allocating to a custom basket of widely available Mutual Funds and ETFs, which embed a variety of capital efficient exposures to equities, bonds and alternative strategies
- Assets are allocated to 10 mutual funds/ETFs with weights between 3% - 15%, with weights adding up to 100%. Due to the leverage in some of these funds, the notional exposure adds up to 160%.
