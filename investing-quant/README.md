#### Factors

[Capital Gains blog](https://capitalgains.thediff.co/p/thinking-about-factors): Thinking about factors
- If factors work, the next question is: why? And this doesn't just mean asking why some companies are statistically more likely to produce good returns on capital, but why investors systematically underestimate them.
- For momentum: Some investors underreact to changes in fundamentals. It's sort of like a single-asset version of Andrew Lo's _adaptive markets hypothesis_: if who is the smartest analyst for a given asset changes over time, then at any given time the newest smartest-analyst probably won't have the asset base necessary to push the stock all the way to where it ought to trade. One of the ideas behind that theory is that "To the extent that a relation between risk and reward exists, it is unlikely to be stable over time. This relation is influenced by the relative sizes and preferences of populations and by institutional aspects. As these factors change, any risk/reward relation is likely to change as well."
- Two general ways to use factors: (1) use them as the basis for screening stocks, (2) use them to analyze the factor weights of your portfolio, and adjust it to make it factor-neutral or more weighted towards certain factors
