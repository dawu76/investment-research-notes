### College financial aid based on income & assets

The financial aid is usually like a sliding scale, so even if your income is above the threshold, you can get part of the costs covered. *BUT* those big announcements about free tuition for incomes less than $150K or $200K ignore one big thing -- the schools do not actually just use income to decide how much financial aid to give. They also look at overall household assets, so if you make less than $200K but more than "typical assets" for a family that makes that much, then you will still have to pay part of the tuition.

Some of the bigger schools like Harvard have "net price calculators" that estimate what your family's contribution would be based on the annual income + assets you specify.
- based on these calculators, the big news headlines about "free tuition for families making under $X" are sort of dishonest. it's just marketing for the schools.
- the schools say that if your income falls below the threshold, then you'll get free tuition if your family has "typical assets". but the threshold for typical assets is so low. for example, the Columbia financial aid FAQ says, "For families with an income of $100,000, we would consider typical assets to be approximately $250,000." that's very low! they pretty much require you to NOT have any assets outside of your home and retirement accounts. if you saved wisely over your working years or if you own part of a business (like an auto repair shop or medical office), that's counted against you and heavily penalizes you in the financial aid calculations.
- Even if you have very low income, any assets in your bank, non-retirement brokerage account, or your business will cause your tuition payments to increase a lot. 

if you play with Harvard's Net Price Calculator tool, you get these estimated financial aid numbers

- income: $50K, parent assets: $0     --> student pays $3,500
- income: $50K, parent assets: $100K  --> student pays $3,500
- income: $50K, parent assets: $200K  --> student pays $7,000
- income: $50K, parent assets: $300K  --> student pays $10,500
- income: $50K, parent assets: $400K  --> student pays $14,000
- income: $50K, parent assets: $500K  --> student pays $17,500
- income: $50K, parent assets: $750K  --> student pays $26,250
- income: $50K, parent assets: $1M    --> student pays $35,000
- income: $100K, parent assets: $0    --> student pays $3,500
- income: $100K, parent assets: $100K --> student pays $3,500
- income: $100K, parent assets: $200K --> student pays $7,000
- income: $100K, parent assets: $300K --> student pays $10,500
- income: $100K, parent assets: $400K --> student pays $14,000
- income: $100K, parent assets: $500K --> student pays $17,500
- income: $100K, parent assets: $750K --> student pays $26,250
- income: $100K, parent assets: $1M   --> student pays $35,000

Even if your household income is very low ($50K for a family of 4, which is not much above poverty level in many parts of CA), your expected tuition payment still goes up as your household assets go up.

A school like Harvard can say, 'our degree is so valuable that you should be thankful that you're getting a discount.' which might be true, but still, the reality is very different from the idea that tuition is $0, even for low-income households. so if your income is as low as $50K, but you have $500K in assets that you need to preserve (because it's part of your business, or because you're disabled and living off of the interest income), then you still have to take out a loan to pay for college.

... Need less than those thresholds for both income and assets to qualify for free tuition. The example was for Columbia specifically; their free tuition upper income threshold is $150K if you have "typical assets".
- but according to their website: _"Parents’ assets include cash, savings, investments, home equity, other real estate equity, and business equity. Retirement assets are not included in our financial aid analysis. For families with total calculated income up to $150,000, we consider typical assets are those up to approximately $250,000."_
- so it's also a policy that seems more generous than it really is, because in their assets calculation, they include equity in your home and business.
- if you own a home in an expensive area, your home equity will definitely be more than $250K, especially if you're old enough to have college age kids. and if you own a business that generates enough income for you to raise a family, then its value will also push your asset value up beyond that asset value threshold.
- if either of those conditions is true, then you'll need to pay a portion of the tuition costs. it's only a very specific demographic profile that can get free tuition from these colleges: a wage slave who didn't save at all for the future, or whose savings are entirely in their retirement accounts.

... For med schools, it's possible that it really is tuition-free regardless of income. 
- like NYU's med school recently announced a similar policy. on their website, they say: _"Every student admitted into the MD program at NYU Grossman School of Medicine automatically receives a scholarship to cover the full cost of our medical school tuition. No application is necessary to receive the Full-Tuition Scholarship."_
- The fact that it's awarded without the need for applications likely means that they don't even look at your household income.

### WSJ: Congress’s College Financial Aid Fiasco [2023-12-21]

The revised student aid form means middle-class parents will pay more.
- The new FAFSA reduces the number of questions to about three dozen in part by pulling information from student and parent tax returns at the Internal Revenue Service. This information will be plugged into a new formula to calculate a “student aid index,” which determines how much families could afford to contribute to a child’s college education.
According to the Education Department, 1.5 million more students will be able to access the maximum Pell award, which is $7,395 this year. But the new formula will also result in many middle-class families paying much more for college.
- The current FAFSA reduces a family’s expected contribution proportionately to the number of children in college at the same time. If the FAFSA determines a family with two children can afford to pay $15,000 for college in a given year, the family’s expected contribution to each child’s education would be $7,500. The new FAFSA eliminates this sibling discount. The Brookings Institution estimates that a family with $150,000 in income with two children in college would see eligibility for aid at private colleges fall $12,600 in a year.
- The current FAFSA excludes assets of small businesses and family farms. No more. The new FAFSA will require families to report small business and farm assets, including land, buildings and machinery. It doesn’t matter if the assets aren’t liquid. Iowa College Aid, a state agency, simulated the impact of this change on a dependent student from a family of four with $60,000 in income and a farm net worth of $1 million. Under the new formula, the amount they would be expected to pay for the child’s college would increase to $41,056 from $7,626.
- Parents who are sole proprietors might have to borrow against their business assets to pay tuition. But there’s a loophole: Families with less than $60,000 in income or with one member who has received a federal means-tested benefit in the last two years won’t have to report assets. This is an inducement for every college student to sign up for Medicaid.
