Engage in pattern recognition. Study market history in order to better understand the implications of today’s events.  Ironically, when viewed over the long term, investor psychology and thus market cycles – which seem flighty and unpredictable – fluctuate in ways that approach dependability (if you’re willing to overlook their highly variable causality, timing, and amplitude).
- Understand that cycles stem from what I call “excesses and corrections” and that a strong movement in one direction is more likely to be followed – sooner or later – by a correction in the opposite direction than by a trend that “grows to the sky.” 
- "I define cycles not as a series of up and down movements, each of which regularly precedes the next – which I believe is the usual definition – but as a series of events, each of which causes the next. This causality holds the key to understanding cycles.  In particular, I think economies, investor psychology, and thus markets eventually go too far in one direction or another – they become too positive or too negative – and afterward they eventually swing back toward moderation (and then usually toward excess in the opposite direction).  Thus, in my opinion, these cycles are best understood as stemming from 'excesses and corrections.'"

Watch for moments when most people are so optimistic that they think things can only get better, an expression that usually serves to justify the dangerous view that “there’s no price too high.”  Likewise, recognize when people are so depressed that they conclude things can only get worse, as this often means they think a sale at any price is a good sale. 
- When the herd’s thinking is either Pollyannaish or apocalyptic, the odds increase that the current price level and direction are unsustainable. Once in a while – once or twice a decade, perhaps – markets go so high or so low that the argument for action is compelling and the probability of being right is high.
- Avoid making macro calls too often.  I wouldn’t want to try to make a living predicting the outcome of coin tosses or figuring out whether the favorite will cover the point spread in every football game over the course of a season. You have to pick your spots – as Warren Buffett puts it, wait for a fat pitch. Most of the time, you have nothing to lose by abstaining from trying to adroitly get in and out of the markets: you merely participate in their long-term trends, and those have been very favorable.
- I don’t think consistently profitable market calls can be manufactured out of macroeconomic forecasts. Nor do I believe you can beat the market simply by analyzing company reports. On both subjects, as Andrew puts it (see my memo Something of Value, January 2021), “readily available quantitative data regarding the past and present” can’t hold the secret to superior performance since it’s available to everyone.

Remember that in extreme times, because of the above, the secret to making money lies in contrarianism, not conformity. 
- When emotional investors take an extreme view of an asset’s future and, as a result, take the price to unjustified levels, the “easy money” is usually made by doing the opposite.  This is, however, very different from simply diverging from the consensus all the time.  Indeed, most of the time, the consensus is as close to right as most individuals can get.  So to be successful at contrarianism, you have to understand (a) what the herd is doing, (b) why it’s doing it, (c) what’s wrong with it, and (d) what should be done instead and why.

What does avoiding macro forecasting mean to us?  My answer is as follows:
- We generally assume the macro environment of the future will resemble past norms.  We then make allowance for the possibility that things will be worse than normal.  Ensuring our investments have a generous “margin of safety” makes it more likely they’ll do okay even if future macro developments disappoint somewhat.
- What we never do is project that the macro environment will be distinctly better than normal in some way, making winners out of particular investments.  Doing so can lead to profits if one is right, but it’s hard to consistently make such forecasts correctly. It’s our goal to construct portfolios where the surprises will be *on the upside.*

What does it mean when we say, “we’re not market timers”?  For me, it means the following:
- We don’t sell things we consider attractive long-term holdings to raise cash in expectation of a market decline.  We usually sell because (a) a holding has reached our target price, (b) the investment case has deteriorated, or (c) we’ve found something better.  Our open-end portfolios are almost always fully invested; that way we avoid the risk of missing out on positive returns.  It also means buying usually necessitates some selling.
- We don’t say, “It’s cheap today, but it’ll be cheaper in six months, so we’ll wait.”  If it’s cheap, we buy.  If it gets cheaper and we conclude the thesis is still intact, we buy more.  We’re much more afraid of missing a bargain-priced opportunity than we are of starting to buy a good thing too early.

### Risk management

From Klarman's "Margin of Safety":

> Many investors mistakenly establish an investment goal of achieving a specific rate of return. Setting a goal, unfortunately, does not make that return achievable. Indeed, no matter what the goal, it may be out of reach. Stating that you want to earn, say, 15 percent a year, does not tell you a thing about how to achieve it. Investment returns are not a direct function of how long or hard you work or how much you wish to earn. A ditch digger can work an hour of overtime for extra pay, and a piece worker earns more the more he or she produces. An investor cannot decide to think harder or put in overtime in order to achieve a higher return. All an investor can do is follow a consistently disciplined and rigorous approach; over time the returns will come.

> Rather than targeting a desired rate of return, even an eminently reasonable one, investors should target risk. Treasury bills are the closest thing to a riskless investment; hence the interest rate on Treasury bills is considered the risk-free rate. Since investors always have the option of holding all of their money in T-bills, investments that involve risk should only be made if they hold the promise of considerably higher returns than those available without risk. This does not express an investment preference for T-bills; to the contrary, you would rather be fully invested in superior alternatives. But alternatives with some risk attached are superior only if the return more than fully compensates for the risk.
