- Reliance on extended historical data is associated with the lower probability of early abandonment of the strategy and with the higher cumulative returns. However, only risk-tolerant investors in our study are able to capture the full extent of the benefit of information that is made available to them. 
- Risk-tolerant and well-informed investors about possible drawdowns investors achieve significantly better results when they use extended historical sample developing their prior beliefs about possible investment outcomes. They almost never abandon their investment strategy, ride the market in and out of the crisis, and enjoy attractive full-period returns. On the contrary, investors who exhibit risk-neutral or risk-averse behavior, as well as those who rely on short-term history in developing their investment beliefs, easily exit and lose their investment opportunities. Furthermore, performance of Risk Parity and Dynamic portfolios relies most heavily on the extent of information available to investors in all investment horizons and regardless of their risk preferences.
- We also study the effect of the opportunity to re-enter the investment strategy once market uncertainty settles and find the overwhelming evidence that the re-entry option improves investment outcomes. However, adherence to the strategy during the entire anticipated investment period is still superior to exit and re-entry in most cases.
