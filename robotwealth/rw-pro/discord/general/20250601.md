### 2025 June Discord notes [up to 2025-06-12]

Right now, I'm making over 100%/yr in high yield ETFs with little work so maybe I don't care. [[link](https://discord.com/channels/1368787013763072040/1368844123251015751/1377653456545779822)]
- For example: MSTY. A number of people on this site will tell you that you can DIY by selling covered calls.  Maybe/Maybe not. You have to work your own math and factor in your own time to execute.  My time is valuable. Others may tell you that the risk is high.  Maybe/Maybe not.  I don't know. These investments are typically done on margin.  I am using reasonable margin and have been doing this for about 6 months.  All dividends have been reinvested. I am currently making 109%/year if the dividends continue.  They probably won't.  But I'm in about 10 ETFs so there is some diversification. Think carefully about your own personal risk tolerance before jumping in.  Over 100% per year sounds great until we find out that we missed a key issue.

"Speaking of replicating high yield etf": Mark Phillips' [Substack post](https://thetill.substack.com/p/how-to-buy-a-rolex-every-two-years), 'How to buy a Rolex every two years'.
- > Whether you’re using 10,000 shares or only 1,000 of AAPL, following the size and strike algorithm achieved superior gross and net yields, and left the investor with a higher capital account balance. While all of these are conditional on the relatively short track record of comparison, this same dynamic was true in all of the seven selected stocks.
- > By adjusting the distribution knobs, one can bias the strategy to preserve more capital or yield more. That’s not going to be available in an ETF. Further, in a case like JPM you can have your cake and eat it too - literally.
- > Thanks to stock performance and some deft trading, with HVF_JPM targeting 2% distributions, you not only end up with an average monthly distribution amount of 2% with a tight and consistent range, the baseline pie is getting bigger. And the distributions are more tax efficient.

"Maybe a dumb question, but how which  strategy should i be adding to a portfolio for a start? as many as possible as long it is uncorrelated? Seems VRP should be a main strat while adding smaller zero sum ones?"
- If you’re starting from nothing, I’d start with a simple **risk premia harvesting strategy** like stocks, bonds, and gold. Then I’d add the **bond seasonality** and **rebalancing** game strategies because they just modify your existing holdings. Then it’s up to you - wanna stay in that tradfi account ... do the VRP thing. Got crypto? Try a breakout (or the YOLO). I’m actually doing the crypto breakout using IBIT and EETH in my tradfi account so that’s an option too.
- Regarding the 'crypto breakout strategy': the latest is in the Excel Edge course. It was in the crypto Lambo course too. Another comment: "Scott [Philips] gives the basic strategy here too [in this Flirting with Models interview] (on [YouTube](youtube.com/watch?si=1GI7rmCv8Pgm1lnz&v=I4n3KX4zYPA&feature=youtu.be)). Listen to the crypto trend goat himself talk about it."
- I think this depends on your goals, what your risk appetite is, and what operational overhead you're willing to deal with. I personally find it helpful to start at a smaller size than my theoretical allocation (typically a 1/3rd), and either make some mistakes or suffer through a few drawdowns before adding more size.
- Euan: Also, don't get too hung up on finding uncorrelated stuff. **Almost all profitable things at a given time scale are positively correlated**. Even more so in stress scenarios. Just make money. It is a lot easier to suffer drawdowns if you are already up. [In response to comment, 'This is quite different from what I have heard so far, can you elaborate a bit on this?'] Just that often people see someone on twitter say "I've got five uncorrelated strategies and combined I get a Sharpe of 6". It's not true of anyone except larpers. That is obviously good but it won't be true. There aren't 5 uncorrelated strategies. Any reduction in correlation is good. 85% is better than 100. **The way real quant funds operate is to have 100 85% correlated things.** For an individual this isn't possible. There is a point where management difficulties outweigh benefits. I think this is one of those 'solving a problem before it arrives' things. Just make money.
- Kris: Adding to the good advice above, your operational constraints will play a big role too obviously. If you're only able to be at the screens for end of day, trying to do faster stuff will send you crazy. Also depends on your account - if you don't have a lot of buying power, the equity pairs strategy won't be viable. But the VRP thing will be.

"I wanted to do the research for the **pairs trading strategy** for universe of stocks outside of the US and I wanted your advice on where to start with the code? I went through the GitHub repository but unfortunately couldn’t get my head around where to start from since I’m mostly familiar with Python. Would really appreciate your help. Thanks."
- What you see in that repo is just the SQL code for reproducing the universe selection pipeline. I think you'll get a much better sense of what it's doing if you go through the original courses for context. The first half of the [ML and Big Data](https://robotwealth.com/courses/machine-learning-bootcamp/) course (modules 1 - 6) will give you all the info. In the [pairs trading course](https://robotwealth.com/courses/rw-pro-alpha-pairs-trading-bootcamp/), we did some additional research for the time stop and some implementation stuff. Definitely worth including that for context too.

... I was wondering if anyone has been trading the pairs trading strategy with the PTPs excluded because of the IRS witholding charges (10% of the sales proceeds) for non-US taxpayers? My backtest is showing basically flat results for the past 3-4 years.
- Yes! We discussed this a while back - excluding the PTPs is recommended and how I've been trading it. IB maintains a list of PTPs.

"it might be a silly question but for pairs trading, do we need to use adjusted close prices or unadj close prices?"
- Kris: Use adjusted for anything that you need to calculate returns for.

"What’s generally best practice for when things dis/qualify for a universe. E.g top x market cap, if two tickers are close and keep dropping in and out?"
- Mark Aron / Unravel: "we do the following: (1) aggressive volume / OI filters or somewhat equivalent to that -- multiple sorting metrics, average their rank; (2) apply moving averages on the primary ranking metric, before calculating the rank (can be even 3 months MA or so); (3) update the universe less frequently (once a week / month / quarter)

"There used to be a python version of the rwRtools in github, rwPtools or something. Just noticed that it's no longer there -- is it still maintained?"
- Kris: No, it's no longer being maintained. Currently looking to hire for some tech help, which will increase our capacity to offer stuff like this.
