## The mistakes that traders make

### Is Trading a Game We Can Lose?

Losing at games of pure skill vs. luck
- Is it actually possible to lose money on purpose trading? And if so, what is the best strategy? It’s very easy to lose at chess because chess is a deterministic game of skill. There is no external random element. There’s no roll of the dice. There are well-defined rules. It’s just you versus the opposition. And, whilst it might be hard to identify really good moves in chess, it’s easy to identify bad moves.
- So you can lose at chess. On the other extreme, snakes and ladders is entirely a game of chance. Luck is the only factor. There is no skill involved. So it’s impossible to lose on purpose at snakes and ladders, unless you cheated somehow.
- In the middle is poker. Poker involves both skill and luck. In the short-term, luck dominates, but over the long run, all that luck averages out, and the best player will win and the worst player will lose. I think it’s clear to everyone that trading is more like poker than any of the other games here. Markets are highly unpredictable and short-term outcomes are dominated by chance. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that long-run outcomes are dominated by skill. It doesn’t mean we can necessarily win but, given what we know about the market, we can definitely lose.

Retail traders often do things that almost guarantee that they will lose money. There are three dominant strategies for losing money. I call them the mortal sins.

You might think that retail traders lose money because they are taking the wrong trades. You might think that they are buying when they should be selling and selling when they should be buying. And that if they did the opposite of what their instincts told them to do, maybe they’d make money? But that’s not it - these traders aren’t incredible “negative alpha” generating machines making lousy buy and sell decisions. 

They’re losing money because they are doing one or many of these three things: 
- They are trading **too often** – opening and closing positions without edge and paying lots of transaction costs.
- They are trading **too big** – sizing too big and losing lots of money, which is very bad because you need money to make more money.
- They are **trying to be heroes** – they’re taking heroic or highly specific bets.

### Every time you trade you lose money

Every time you trade you lose money. It’s an expensive business!
- You pay a commission and a bunch of other fees.
- You pay a spread on the entry and exit price of each trade – it costs more to buy than you get for selling; you have to tip your market maker.
- Your trades will tend to push price against you if they are large. Your buying will make the asset you are trying to buy more expensive.

The most reliable way to lose money as a trader is to instantaneously open and close positions. Open and close, open and close, open and close. On every one of these trades, you’re going to take a loss. The loss you take will increase with the number of trades you take. It’s going to be a reliable grind down until you have no money left to trade. So trading decisions require a balancing act. You have to trade to make money of course. But you only want to do it when it’s worth the cost to do so.  It’s a balancing act between **uncertain gains and certain losses**.
