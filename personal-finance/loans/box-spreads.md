## [Bloomberg](https://archive.is/aTK3D): How Affluent Investors Are Using Options Math to Borrow on the Cheap [2025-10-29]]

> Tony Yang used a "box spread" trade to borrow $650,000 at 1.6% for five years to help finance a Bay Area home, creating a down payment without having to sell assets.
> Box spread loans, also called synthetic borrowing, require sizable portfolios to back them and offer speed, flexibility, and often a lower cost than traditional bank credit, plus potential tax advantages.
> The approach is catching on among wealth advisers, with SyntheticFi bringing on over 100 financial advisers to guide clients through the process, and Vest Financial launching its synthetic-borrow platform, which delivers institutionally priced financing to the retail market.

> In late 2021, as the housing market overheated and the Federal Reserve’s benchmark interest rate hovered near zero, Tony Yang found an unconventional way to fund his down payment.
He logged into his Charles Schwab brokerage account, built a trade he’d discovered on Reddit — and unlocked about $650,000 to help finance a Bay Area home.
>
> The trade, dubbed a “box spread,” carried a kind of mystique. By combining two opposing options positions — one bullish, one bearish — Yang built a strategy that mimics a fixed-rate loan: upfront cash now, repayment at a set date, and a locked-in cost in between.
>
> Yang used it to borrow at just 1.6% for five years — well below the rate on his traditional mortgage — creating a down payment without having to sell assets he wanted to keep in the market.
> “The stock market was doing really well in 2021, and I felt it was a bad time to sell to make the down payment in cash,” said Yang, who was working for payments company Stripe Inc. at that time. “Borrowing against it keeps me in the market and avoids capital gains tax.”

> Now, that same strategy powers [SyntheticFi](https://www.syntheticfi.com/), a San Francisco-based fintech Yang co-founded to help others do the same. Box spread loans, also called synthetic borrowing, aren’t accessible to every buyer. They require sizable portfolios to back them. But for those with the assets, they offer speed, flexibility, and often a lower cost than traditional bank credit — plus potential tax advantages.

> Once a tool for hedge funds and family offices, box-spread loans now sit alongside direct indexing, custom portfolios, and options overlays — all pitched as tax-efficient ways to gain financial control. For affluent investors, they’re a means to stay invested, defer taxes, and unlock liquidity without touching traditional lenders. It’s part of a broader shift: strategies built for institutional desks are being repackaged as personal-finance hacks for a new kind of well-heeled borrower — risk-tolerant, control-seeking, and comfortable navigating complexity. They’re not avoiding debt; they’re engineering it on their own terms.

> The approach is catching on among wealth advisers. Tyler Miles, managing director at Wedmont Private Capital, in July made a cash offer for a four-bedroom house in Howard County, Maryland. Working with SyntheticFi,
> he was able to close the deal the following month.
>
> “I didn’t even look at a traditional mortgage,” he said. “We wanted to be competitive, we wanted to be able to close quickly, and that wasn’t going to fit that timeline.”
>
> This year, Miles has advised a dozen clients on similar financing, using the loans to fund vehicle purchases, new business ventures, and more. In a box spread, two sets of options with matching strike prices — call spreads and put spreads — create predictable cash flows that closely mimic fixed income. By selling one, an investor receives a lump sum of cash upfront, and agrees to pay a preset amount at maturity. It’s a strategy that behaves predictably — until markets act up.

> Table: Borrowing via an options trade is cheaper than traditional margin loan

> interest rate for a 1-year $100K loan
> - box spread loan: 4.03%
> - Schwab pledged asset line: 8.55%
> - Schwab margin loan: 10.83%

> The gap between what the investor receives upfront and repays at maturity determines the effective interest rate — now roughly 5 to 20 basis points above comparable Treasury yields, according to Vest Financial, a $54  billion derivatives-based asset manager that officially launched its synthetic‑borrow platform this week.
“We have taken the financing that’s embedded in the option market, which is institutionally priced, and we’ve delivered it” to the retail market, said Karan Sood, Vest’s chief executive officer.

> Box spreads have long been a trading tool on Wall Street, used to shift money across books or lock in small pricing gaps. What’s changed is who’s using them. SyntheticFi has brought on more than 100 financial advisory firms to guide clients through the process. To users, it feels like a faster, cheaper alternative to a bank loan. There’s no credit check, no underwriting — just a few clicks to convert investment holdings into cash. “It’s a low-interest-rate loan against your own assets with some interesting bells and whistles,” said Chris Whitaker, chief wealth manager at Apriem. One of his clients recently used the strategy to finance a boat.
>
> Synthetic borrow could disrupt the lending environment, according to Sam Gaeta, founder of Defined Financial Planning. “Banks often rely on other value-added services, such as securities-backed lending, to win wealth management business,” he said. “If we can offer a solution that allows clients to access liquidity using the margin power of their investment portfolio at an implied interest rate similar to the risk-free rate, the banks lose some of that leverage in their value proposition to clients.”

> But the math only works if the market does. If stocks fall, so does the value of the collateral. That triggers margin calls — the same mechanism that has unraveled countless trades in past downturns. If the client can’t post more collateral, their portfolio gets liquidated. The promise of frictionless money becomes forced selling. Box-spread loans “are strategies that get popular during a bull run or stable markets,” said Mayank Mohan, the founder of Museum Mile Funds, which helps institutional clients optimize cash and margin yields through derivatives. “If there is a sharp decline in market values, these strategies can become sources of forced deleveraging and will make headlines for the wrong reasons.”
>
> Vest counters that the threat of margin calls isn’t unique to box spreads — it’s inherent to any portfolio-backed loan. The key, the firm argues, is professional oversight: tools like this should be built by experts, managed with strong technology, and deployed by advisers who can actively monitor and mitigate risks.
For now, the risk feels distant to those who are short on cash but reluctant to sell their investments. At SyntheticFi, business is booming, with the amount of box spread loans surging over 10-fold this year.
Yang plans to roll the position forward when it matures next year. His co-founder Joseph Wang uses his to pay off a credit card.
>
> “There are probably tens of millions of Americans who have an investment portfolio and can use box spread as a financing strategy that’s better than any clause that you get out there,” said Yang. “It could save them a ton of money on big transactions.”

## [cboe.com](https://archive.is/ya3uK#selection-1799.0-1799.183): Long-Dated Box Spreads: A Better Way to Buy a Home [2025-03-26]

> Consider a hypothetical example: Tony is eyeing a $2MM property in DC. With a $3MM portfolio, how could he best finance his purchase? Traditionally, Tony would pay 20% down by selling $400K of his portfolio and take out a $1.6MM mortgage. This is suboptimal - he would face significant tax consequences, lose the upside potential of his investments, and pay for a ~7%1 mortgage.
>
> Box Spreads, especially longer-dated ones, offer an appealing alternative. Tony can borrow money at near-benchmark rates by selling a Box Spread. Using a 5-year Box Spread, he can secure a tax-deductible 4.6% fixed rate for 5 years. Even better, he can keep his full $3MM portfolio invested and working for him. Together, the Box Spread strategy combined with the jumbo mortgage would save Tony over $200K in five years. Amazing!

> By combining the two positions below, Box Spreads’ final payoff is fixed at expiration. Cboe offers SPX index options with up to 5-year expiry, which we will use as an example. When the synthetic long and short illustrated above are combined, you end up with a guaranteed payout. Why? Intuitively, imagine buying (longing) Apple stock (AAPL) at price K2 and selling (shorting) the same AAPL at a different price K1; the payoff will only be determined by the difference in the buying and selling prices, K2 - K1, regardless of how Apple moves. The same idea applies to SPX, creating a fixed payout equal to the difference between the two strikes, K2 - K1.
>
> The only question left is how much premium is received upfront. This upfront premium acts as the loan principal and is set by the liquid Box Spread market. Since Box Spreads use European-style options, early assignment risk is eliminated, ensuring a fixed final payoff - a debit - at expiration. Because the final payout is predetermined, the implied interest rate - derived from the upfront premium - aligns with the base Fed Funds rate, as reflected in market pricing.

> Recent increases in trading volume of longer-dated Box Spreads, particularly those with three-year and five-year expiries, have made them appealing alternatives to mortgages. The implied interest rates on Box Spreads are often just 30-50 bps higher than three- and five-year Treasury yields, remaining below 5% - a significant improvement over today's 7%+ 5/1 ARM mortgage rates.
>
> In practice, to withdraw this upfront premium, clients need sufficient collateral in their brokerage account holding the Box Spread. What qualifies as "sufficient" is determined by their custodian’s margin requirements. Under Reg T margin, a $1MM portfolio of stocks and ETFs can typically support a $500K withdrawal.

Benefits
> - ~30% rate discount compared to a jumbo mortgage: Box Spread offers ultra-competitive interest rates, often just 20 bps above benchmark rates. For Tony, compared to a 7% jumbo mortgage, he would secure a ~4.6% rate through Box Spreads - about 30 bps above the five-year Treasury Bill rate.
> - uncapped interest deduction as capital losses: Instead of cash paid to a bank, the “interest” on a Box Spread appears as a loss on the options trade. This makes the “interest” fully tax-deductible as a capital loss.
“Fully” here means there is no cap. For comparison, mortgage interest is only deductible on the first $750K principal of qualified home loan debt - any interest paid on mortgages for principal exceeding $750K is not tax-deductible. In contrast, the “interest” on Box Spreads is fully deductible with no limit. Under IRS Section 1256, box spreads on SPX options are subject to mark-to-market taxation at year-end. The accrued “interest” is deducted annually, even though the trade settles at expiration (e.g., in 5 years). These deductions follow the IRS Sec. 1256, with 60% treated as a long-term capital loss and 40% as a short-term capital loss. By stacking the two deductions, Tony’s effective blended financing rate drops to 3.63%3 after tax - more than 2.45% lower than an after-tax 5/1 ARM, translating to ~$49K in annual savings.
> - no need to sell for a down payment = fully invested + no capital gains: Using Box Spreads to finance real estate eliminates the need to sell assets for a down payment. This allows clients to stay fully invested without incurring a large capital gains tax.
