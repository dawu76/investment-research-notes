Question for Kris: "Wonder if when you have time you could share your experience on this? It was related to the blogpost that Nx0 shared."

> Never tried it seriously in the time series like in the post, but my professional trading life was mostly low-latency spread trading. It was.... difficult to say the least. Personally, I would never try to do it as a solo trader in tradfi markets. Just too much to manage and so much that can go wrong in a highly competitive arena. It would be more conceivable for indie traders in crypto - but likely getting harder (we did a bit of this back in the FTX days), or possibly in less liquid/mature markets. But it's a full time job.

> ... Assuming you weren't click trading it Kris, what was the most operationally intensive part of it? Do you have any stories of things that did go wrong and how you managed them?

Kris: Let's start with the fact that there are different stages of the life cycle of a trading system like the one we were running
- Research and model development
- Execution software development, including compliance with exchange requirements
- Tracking and monitoring - especially fills vs "arrival price" - there are challenges of quoting both legs (one will inevitably run away from you at some point).
- Measuring latency at different points in the system.
- Babysitting live trading and fixing issues on the fly
- Improving and iterating 
- Interpreting results of monitoring 
- Faster execution
- Smarter quoting/hitting algorithm
- Each of those stages has its own problems. And most of those stages overlap with one another in time - they're all happening in parallel, essentially. So even the prioritisation and project management aspects have their own challenges. 

It's hard to say what the biggest issues were. But when I was doing the global futures stuff, the execution challenges were significant. Part of our edge was just providing liquidity to lumpy flow. We were hedging the risk elsewhere. Our hedging algorithm would try to quote that leg as well, which is really difficult to do in practice. We spent a lot of time on that thing. 

When we were doing it in crypto, it was more your traditional latency arbitrage - see a stale quote that's far enough from your model of fair value to be worth your while and try to be the first to hit it. Since we were just hitting quotes, the execution was a lot simpler... we essentially managed it with "fill or kill" type orders. And we didn't bother hedging... just let the variance wash out over time. 

With the crypto stuff, we were also aware that there was a limit to how much we could compete. There would come a time when someone faster or with a better model would simply outcompete us. Figuring out when to pull the pin and when to engage in the arms race was a real challenge that required understanding the opportunity, as well as the opportunity cost of prioritising this over other opportunities.

Question: How do you track your trades, strategies and overall portfolios? Personally I have a database where I save every transaction, strategy signal and portfolio info which I just host locally. Then I am making a simple dashboard to visualize it.
- Kris: I've pretty much gone to just tracking strategy and platform p&l in a spreadsheet. But I've really simplified my trading the last ~18 months. I used to track strategy performance pretty carefully, including stuff that I stopped trading. But now I basically do that via the strategy simulation notebooks in the lab at irregular intervals.
- I added SQLite - containing trades only - to calculate realised & unrealised P&L on the fly, and amend their open quantity contributing to P&L. This is a personal preference, to do this real time, instead of doing it periodically outside of the execution software. But probably the P&L calculation can be done with using a trades CSV file only, or with Excel voodoo.
