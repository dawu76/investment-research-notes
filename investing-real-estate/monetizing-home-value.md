## Monetizing one's home equity in the retirement years

What would be the results of these two options for a retired couple:
- option 1: selling the primary residence and living off of the proceeds, which have been invested in dividend and interest-yielding assets that earn ~5% per year (to be conservative)
- option 2: taking out a reverse mortgage and living off of the proceeds

So far, it looks like (1) leaves you with more money to pass onto the kids, even after taking into account the big capital gains tax you would have to pay with option (1).

Disadvantages of each
- With option (1): you have to pay taxes on capital gains above $500,000 for married couple. for someone who bought their house 20+ years ago in the Bay Area, that means a very large capital gains tax bill. assuming capital gains tax rate of 20%, that would probably be a few hundred thousand dollars in taxes -- painful. 
- With option (2): with reverse mortgages in the US, you're taking out a loan against the value of your home. and the more expensive the home, and the larger the % of the home equity you want to borrow, the higher the interest rate on this loan! for a home in an expensive neighborhood, a "jumbo" reverse mortgage would be required, and even then, you might be allowed to borrow just 60% or so of the home's full value. and the interest rates on this reverse mortgage loan would be higher due to its 'jumbo' status -- maybe as high as 10% per year.

The final results of this comparison would depend on your annual living expenses and how long you continue living after selling the home.

But under a few reasonable assumptions:
- A likely result of option (1) is that most or all of the principal from the home sale is preserved, as the interest / dividends / capital appreciation from your investments is enough to fund your daily living expenses. so your kids would inherit the value of the principal from the home sale. of course, the value of this principal would be degraded by inflation, but it would still be a decent amount of money after 25 years, even after taking inflation into account (unless the Federal Reserve goes crazy and prints too much money). 
- A likely result of option (2) is that you'd end up borrowing more than the home's actual value, after taking the high interest rate on the loan into account. since a reverse mortgage is a "non-recourse loan", the amount owed can never exceed the home's value, which means your kids wouldn't have to pay back the difference. but it also means they wouldn't inherit anything.

---

A 3rd option would be moving to a smaller, cheaper place and renting out the home.
- The net income from this - rental income minus (property taxes + home repair and yard maintenance costs) - would definitely be less than option (1). so you would need to rely on your retirement accounts for part of your living expenses. 
- So with this option, you're choosing to live more frugally during your retirement years (compared to option #1) so that your kids can inherit the precious real estate.
- Note: for homes in expensive areas like the Bay Area, the home price-to-rent ratio is really high, which means the income from renting out the place is a pretty small percentage of the home's value and thus less than what you could get from selling the place and investing the proceeds.
