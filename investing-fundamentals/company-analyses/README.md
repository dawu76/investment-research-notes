[Seeking Alpha: Cavanaugh Research](https://archive.is/41yF0): Meta's Q4 Earnings Preview: What You Need To Know
- Assuming the average analyst consensus estimate as a benchmark, it is suggested that Meta's Q4 sales may decrease by around 6.1% compared to the same quarter in 2021. Additionally, analysts have provided EPS estimates ranging from $1.41 to $2.66, with an average of $2.21, which would indicate a year-over-year decline of almost 40%!
- One potential source for upside could be anchored on a recovery in digital advertising. Investors should consider that macro conditions, or at least sentiment and expectations, have materially improved in Q4 2022 as compared to Q3 2022 - with leading banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) now expecting a softish landing. Notably, going into Q2 and Q3 reporting, some advertising players, notably Snap Inc. (SNAP) warned investors about the deteriorating advertising environment. But we have not heard any such warning from any player going into Q4. Investors should also not fail to disregard implications from the China reopening on advertising - as a bullish macro driver for the global economy.
- Martin Sorrell's comments: "I think that is the big thing here [the reopening of China]. And remember... Alphabet/ Google, Amazon, Meta, there second biggest profit centers have historically been outbound Chinese -- Chinese companies targeting business abroad."
- According to Meta's projections, the negative impact of foreign currency on year-over-year total revenue growth in the fourth quarter was estimated to be around 7%, based on current exchange rates at the time of guidance. Since then, however, the U.S. Dollar Index has depreciated materially - by almost 8%!

#### Anti-obesity drugs coming to market

[NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/17/health/weight-loss-drugs-obesity-ozempic-wegovy.html): "We Know Where New Weight Loss Drugs Came From, but Not Why They Work" [2023-08]
- companies: Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly, Amgen
- "At Novo Nordisk, chemists began by using a well-known trick. They loosely attached GLP-1 to a blood protein that kept it stable enough to remain in circulation for at least 24 hours. But when GLP-1 slips off the protein, enzymes in the blood quickly degrade it. So chemists had to alter the hormone’s building blocks — a chain of amino acids — to find a more durable variant. After tedious trial and error, Novo Nordisk produced liraglutide, a GLP-1 drug that lasted long enough for daily injections. They named it Victoza, and the F.D.A. approved it as a treatment for diabetes in 2010. It had an unexpected side effect: slight weight loss."
- Novo Nordisk, which today has 45.7 percent of the global insulin market, thought of itself as a diabetes company. Period. But one company scientist, Lotte Bjerre Knudsen, could not stop thinking about tantalizing results from studies with liraglutide, the GLP-1 drug that lasted long enough to be injected just once a day ... Other studies by academic researchers found that rats lost their appetites if GLP-1 was injected into their brains. Human subjects who got an intravenous drip of GLP-1 ate 12 percent less at a lunch buffet than those who got a placebo."
- On fighting the view that obesity is entirely due to lack of willpower: "Dr. Tschöp’s former colleague at Lilly, Dr. Richard Di Marchi, who also was an executive at Novo Nordisk: “There was very little interest in the industry in doing this,” said Dr. Di Marchi, now at Indiana University. “Obesity was not thought to be a disease. It was looked at as a behavioral problem ... "So why not study liraglutide as both a diabetes drug and an obesity drug, Dr. Knudsen asked. She faced resistance in part because some company executives were convinced that obesity resulted from a lack of willpower." One of the champions of investigating GLP-1 for weight loss, Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, the current chief executive of the Novo Nordisk Foundation and former chief scientific officer of the company, said he “had to spend half a year convincing my C.E.O. that obesity is not just a lifestyle condition.”
- "Despite the progress on weight loss, Novo Nordisk continued to focus on diabetes, trying to find ways to make a longer-lasting GLP-1 so patients would not have to inject themselves every day. The result was a different GLP-1 drug, semaglutide, that lasted long enough that patients had to inject themselves only once a week. It was approved in 2017 and is now marketed as Ozempic. It also caused weight loss — 15 percent, which is three times the loss with Saxenda, the once-a-day drug, although there was no obvious reason for that. Suddenly, the company had what looked like a revolutionary treatment for obesity.
- "In 2021, Novo Nordisk got approval from the F.D.A. to market the same drug for obesity with a weekly injection at a higher maximum dose. It named the drug Wegovy... Wegovy is in such demand, though, that the company is unable to make enough, its spokeswoman Ambre James-Brown said. So for now, while it ramps up production, the company sells the drug only in Norway, Denmark, Germany and the United States. And at pharmacies in those countries, shortages are frequent."
- The drugs, said Randy Seeley, an obesity researcher at the University of Michigan, are not correcting for a lack of GLP-1 in the body — people with obesity make plenty of GLP-1. Instead, the drugs are exposing the brain to hormone levels never seen in nature. Patients taking Wegovy are getting five times the amount of GLP-1 that they would produce in response to a Thanksgiving dinner, Dr. Seeley said. And in the brain, “the drugs go to unusual places.” They are not just going to areas thought to control overeating... GLP-1, because of its chemical structure, should not even get into some areas of the brain where it slips in. “Nobody understands that,” Dr. Seeley said.
- Lilly’s diabetes drug, tirzepatide or Mounjaro, is expected to get F.D.A. approval for obesity this year. It hooks GLP-1 to another gut hormone, GIP. GIP, on its own, produces, at best, a modest weight loss. But the two-hormone combination can allow people to lose a median of about 20 percent of their weight ... Lilly has another drug, retatrutide, that, while still in early stages of testing, seems to elicit a median 24 percent weight loss. Amgen’s experimental drug, AMG 133, could be even better, but is even more of a puzzle. It hooks GLP-1 to a molecule that blocks GIP. There is no logical explanation for why seemingly opposite approaches would work.
