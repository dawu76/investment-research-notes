- Elkamhi, Lee and Salerno grouped the 76 anomalies they studied into five categories according to the classification provided by the authors of the study “Replicating Anomalies”: cross-sectional momentum, intangibles, value versus growth, profitability, and investment
- They are also consistent with those of the authors of the 2018 study “Tail Behavior in Portfolio Optimization for Equity Style Factors,” who examined the performance of the five Fama-French factors (market beta, size, value, investment and profitability)—as well as momentum—to determine how these factors behaved in the tail of their distribution. They concluded: "Our results indicate that Fama-French factors offer diversification benefits during periods when market experiences losses. As a consequence, they comprise a useful source of information when we wish to optimize the asset allocation of our portfolio"
- Traditional portfolios such as 60% equity/40% bonds concentrate the vast majority of their risk in one single factor: market beta. In addition, stock and bond correlations are time-varying/regime dependent. As investors were reminded in 2022, their correlations, while averaging about zero over the long term, can turn sharply positive at the worst time, leading to large portfolio drawdowns. Financial advisors and investors have a large body of evidence demonstrating that adding the unique risks of factor strategies has historically improved portfolio efficiency and reduced the size of drawdowns (which can help investors stay disciplined, avoiding panicked selling)
