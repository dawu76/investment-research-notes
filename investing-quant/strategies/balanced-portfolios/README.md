### Constructing balanced portfolios

**Jason**: we’re combining equal amounts of offence and defense. And then below that, we use that Harry Browne four-quadrant model. So, if I have 25% stocks, 25% bonds, I believe we allocate 25% to long volatility and tail risk, and 25% commodity trend advisors. We also hold a little bit of gold and cryptocurrency for that like fiat hedge. But that’s the way we construct the portfolio.

Now, a lot of people are not going to like that, as you know, because it’s reducing that exposure to 60/40, that 25% each kind of model. And so a lot of people worry about that defensive side, reducing their offensive side.

But what we can do, and this is why we build it as a commodity pool operator using managed futures and options is it allows us that an unbelievable capital efficiency and that cross margin ability, where we can kind of be offsetting these positions. So, it’s a lot easier for us to in-house apply some of that implicit leverage you get with futures and options contracts. Now, hopefully, you’ll push back to me on leverage. 

But the idea is, in-house, what we do then is we’re running 50% global stocks, 50% global bonds. Fifty percent are long volatility ensemble, 50% are commodity trend ensemble. And then we’d run 20% of the gold and cryptocurrencies positions. **So, our total exposure is about 220% or 2.2X.**

**Jason**: From what I just said with the four-quadrant model is like, okay, half your portfolio should be 60/40, and that’d be 25% in long vol. And that’d be 25% in commodity trend managers. Because you need the commodity trend to offset the bond side, and you want the long vol to offset the stock side.

**Meb**: Okay. So, they’re going to give you half their portfolio. I like it. You just upsold everyone on the listeners. I think that makes sense. And so many people reach out to me when they talk about something, like, the CTA and the trend. And they’re always asking, despite me, 100% of the time saying I can’t recommend funds. They say, “What do you think about these funds?” And I say, “You should buy multiple because that gets you away from the binary stress of being, like, why is AQR doing amazing or terrible? Why is this ETF doing amazing or terrible?” I feel like because most people will actually secretly want to gamble. Like, they don’t actually want the correct answer, which would be to buy six of them and just move on. They actually like the concept of perfectly picking the right choice. Tell me when to be in and out of stocks.

**Jason**: It’s ego-destroying. To actually admit that you don’t know the way you and I do and build ensemble approaches, it’s ego-destroying. Where we all want the hero trade, we want to be able to tell our golfing, our fishing buddies, or at a group dinner how great we’re doing, but we don’t talk about our losses. And that’s the way I think that ensemble, like you said, everybody really does actually want to bet because they want to be a hero. And to admit, you can’t predict the future and to broadly diversify is absolutely ego-destroying. And that’s why I don’t think people do it.

"You cannot find me a long only buy & hold allocation that doesn't lose at least a quarter at some point and more likely 50%. Right. Stocks, bonds, real assets, even the most beautiful allocation you can come up with back tested, optimized is probably going to lose a third."

"And I think if you were to ask people, you blindfold them, you go to the, maybe not CALpers, but you go to a more thoughtful organization that has real money, 10, 100, 500 billion dollars. You blindfold them, you present them in Excel sheet and want to return stream. So you put together a portfolio, you can't see what these return streams are. How much is it going to end up in trend following? It's probably going to be 25, 50%. Right. There's no scenario with zero.
