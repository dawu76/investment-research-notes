### Retirement planning & withdrawls

#### Equity vs. bond allocations

"If someone has such a short time horizon, they’re better off locking down a big share of their expected withdrawals in very safe assets at today’s higher yields."
- > One of the most striking aspects of our 2023 retirement income research was that the highest starting safe withdrawal percentage over a 30-year period corresponded with portfolios that had between 20% and 40% in stocks and the remainder in cash and bonds. Over shorter time horizons, the highest starting withdrawal percentages corresponded with even lower equity weightings. Over a 15-year horizon, for example, the highest starting safe withdrawal percentages corresponded with equity weightings of between 10% and 30%.
- > Those conservative asset-allocation recommendations are a function of the higher yields on offer from cash and bonds today, combined with the very conservative spending system that we use as our “base case” for the research. We assume that a retiree wants a stable inflation-adjusted “paycheck” for a 30-year period and is unwilling to vary those paydays based on portfolio performance or any other factor.

But the desired equity allocations increase a lot if we vary withdrawls based on portfolio performance.
- > For retirees using a “guardrails”-type spending system that varies annual withdrawals based on how the portfolio behaved in the year prior, the highest starting withdrawal percentage of 5.5% corresponded with portfolios with between 60% and 70% in equities.
- > Not all retirees are hyperfocused on wringing the highest possible withdrawals from their portfolios. For retirees who are bequest-minded, higher equity allocations are closely linked to larger balances after 30 years. For a retiree using a fixed real withdrawal system for portfolio withdrawals (starting annual dollar amount adjusted thereafter for inflation), higher equity positions tended to contribute to substantially higher leftover balances at the end of 30 years.

So there's a tradeoff here: "A more bond-heavy portfolio might be safer in terms of delivering stable cash flows, but holding more equities provides more opportunities for “upside surprises” in terms of growing the portfolio balance through retirement."

#### Retirement income / withdrawl strategies

"Strategies that involve changing withdrawal amounts from year to year—taking lower withdrawals in weak market environments and perhaps higher paydays in very strong ones—typically allow for higher withdrawal rates. Flexible strategies are effective because they help to prevent retirees from overspending in periods of market weakness, while giving them a raise in stronger market environments."
