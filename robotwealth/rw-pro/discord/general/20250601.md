### 2025 June Discord notes

Right now, I'm making over 100%/yr in high yield ETFs with little work so maybe I don't care. [[link](https://discord.com/channels/1368787013763072040/1368844123251015751/1377653456545779822)]
- For example: MSTY. A number of people on this site will tell you that you can DIY by selling covered calls.  Maybe/Maybe not. You have to work your own math and factor in your own time to execute.  My time is valuable. Others may tell you that the risk is high.  Maybe/Maybe not.  I don't know. These investments are typically done on margin.  I am using reasonable margin and have been doing this for about 6 months.  All dividends have been reinvested. I am currently making 109%/year if the dividends continue.  They probably won't.  But I'm in about 10 ETFs so there is some diversification. Think carefully about your own personal risk tolerance before jumping in.  Over 100% per year sounds great until we find out that we missed a key issue.

Speaking of replicating high yield etf: Mark Phillips' [Substack post](https://thetill.substack.com/p/how-to-buy-a-rolex-every-two-years), 'How to buy a Rolex every two years'.
- > Whether you’re using 10,000 shares or only 1,000 of AAPL, following the size and strike algorithm achieved superior gross and net yields, and left the investor with a higher capital account balance. While all of these are conditional on the relatively short track record of comparison, this same dynamic was true in all of the seven selected stocks.
- > By adjusting the distribution knobs, one can bias the strategy to preserve more capital or yield more. That’s not going to be available in an ETF. Further, in a case like JPM you can have your cake and eat it too - literally.
- > Thanks to stock performance and some deft trading, with HVF_JPM targeting 2% distributions, you not only end up with an average monthly distribution amount of 2% with a tight and consistent range, the baseline pie is getting bigger. And the distributions are more tax efficient.
