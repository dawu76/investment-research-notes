[$QDSIX](https://funds.aqr.com/funds/aqr-diversifying-strategies-fund/qdsix): AQR Diversifying Strategies Fund
- Goal: attractive long-term risk-adjusted returns through strategic allocations to AQR alternative mutual funds; represents an all-in-one solution for investors seeking a strategic, long-term approach to alternatives
- Designed to complement an investor’s traditional stock and bond portfolio, investing in a portfolio of AQR mutual funds (like its risk parity, global macro, and commodities funds), providing exposure to both Active Multi-Asset strategies and Absolute Return strategies
- Active Multi-Asset Strategies: provide tactical and risk-managed allocations among major asset classes across global markets; expected to have some correlation to traditional asset classes over long-term
- Absolute Return Strategies: capture returns from well-established investments styles, such as value and momentum; provide exposure to less accessible types of returns; tends to be uncorrelated to traditional asset classes over long-term
- Implemented as a fund of other funds managed by AQR, e.g. Multi-asset, Equity Market Neutral, Macro Opportunities, Diversified Arbitrage, Managed Futures, etc.
- Availability: not available at E-Trade or TD Ameritrade

[$RLY](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/etfs/funds/spdr-ssga-multi-asset-real-return-etf-rly): SPDR SSgA Multi-Asset Real Return ETF
- Goal: to achieve real return consisting of capital appreciation and current income via exposure to inflation protected securities issued domestically and internationally, domestic and international real estate securities, commodities, and publicly traded companies in natural resources and/or commodity businesses. These companies may include agriculture, energy, and metals and mining companies.
- Strategies: Run as a fund of funds with holdings consisting of 11 other funds, e.g. SPDR S&P Global Natural Resources ETF, Invesco Optimum Yield Diversified Commodity Strategy No K-1 ETF, SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF, SPDR S&P Global Infrastructure ETF, VanEck Agribusiness ETF, SPDR Dow Jones International Real Estate ETF, SPDR Dow Jones REIT ETF, SPDR Bloomberg 1-10 Year TIPS ETF, etc.

[$HDG](https://www.proshares.com/our-etfs/strategic/hdg): Hedge Replication ETF
- Goal: "seeks investment results, before fees and expenses, that track the performance of the Merrill Lynch Factor Model — Exchange Series"
- The Merrill Lynch Factor Model — Exchange Series tries to emulate "the risk and return characteristics of the hedge fund asset class by targeting a high correlation to HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index (HFRI). The HFRI is designed to reflect hedge fund industry performance through an equally weighted composite of over 2,000 constituent funds.
- More about this benchmark: In seeking to maintain a high correlation with the HFRI, the benchmark utilizes a systematic model to establish, each month, weighted long or short (or, in certain cases, long or flat) positions in six underlying factors: (1) S&P 500 Total Return Index, (2) MSCI EAFE US Dollar Net Total Return Index, (3) MSCI Emerging Markets US Dollar Net Total Return Index, (4) Russell 2000 Total Return Index, (5) three-month U.S. Treasury bills, and (6) ProShares UltraShort Euro ETF.
- Note: performance is underwhelming; its 10-year return based on market price and NAV is only 2%, while its return since inception is 1.6%

Risk Parity - [$RPAR, $UPAR](https://www.rparetf.com/quarterlyreviews)
- Nomadic Samuel's [review of $UPAR](https://pictureperfectportfolios.com/upar-ultra-risk-parity-etf-all-weather-portfolio-that-outperforms-stocks/) at Picture Perfect Portfolios: $RPAR offers 120% exposure while $UPAR offers 168% exposure
- $RPAR's allocation: stocks = 25%, commodities = 25% (producer equities = 15%, gold = 10%), Treasuries = 35%, TIPS = 35%
- $UPAR's allocations: stocks = 35% (USA = 17.5%, international = 7%, emerging = 10.5%); commodities = 35% (producer equities = 21%, gold = 14%), Treasuries = 49%, TIPS = 49%
- [Quarterly reviews](https://www.rparetf.com/quarterlyreviews) of performance for $RPAR + [additional resources](https://www.rparetf.com/resource); in particular, see the [Fund Intro](https://www.rparetf.com/rpar/IntrotoRPARRiskParityETF) and the [2022-Q2 review](https://rparetf.com/quarterly-reviews/Review--1658509638-RPARUPAR-Quarterly-Review-Q2-2022-revised2.pdf)
- The [$DBMF 2022-Q2 review](https://imgpfunds.com/imgp-dbi-managed-futures-strategy-etf-second-quarter-2022-commentary/) mentions the surprising outcomes in 2022 that resulted in historically poor risk parity strategies: "Handed a crystal ball in December 2020 that showed 7% CPI (Consumer Price Index) a year later, who would have expected gold to decline ... and commodity-heavy emerging market stocks to underperform global equities by 25%?"
- Per [Bloomberg article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/risk-parity-funds-have-failed-to-work-as-advertised/2022/09/27/a3fda1ea-3e86-11ed-8c6e-9386bd7cd826_story.html), "Risk Parity funds have failed to work as advertised": while risk parity works in theory, and has a respectable track record over the last decade, risk parity funds available to the public have not lived up to theory.
- From the article: "Why do most of the public funds lag the index so much? Two reasons. First, the S&P risk parity index ended up taking 5.0% volatility in stocks, 6.2% in commodities and 6.5% in bonds. Of course, it tries for equal volatility in all three asset classes, but it’s impossible to predict future volatility perfectly. RPARs allocation was 4.1%/2.4%/5.3%, seriously underweight commodities. PanAgora was better, 6.0%/4.5%/5.2%, but still underweight commodities. UPAR was unbalanced with 9.2%/3.6%/7.5%. Wealthfront actually had short equity volatility, with -1.1%/3.0%/4.0%. Only AQR was close to parity with 3.9%/4.6%/4.7%. The second reason was performance relative to constant allocation. The S&P risk parity index beat a constant allocation to the three asset classes by 9.0%. This outperformance comes from changing the allocations over the year to maintain constant volatility, which added significantly to performance. Basically, volatility went up in asset classes before prices fell, and fell before prices rose."

Risk Parity - [$AQRIX](https://funds.aqr.com/Funds/Multi-Asset/AQR-Multi-Asset-Fund#about): AQR Multi-Asset Fund
- Goal: total return based on capital appreciation and income
- Strategies: "allocates risk, rather than dollars, in a balanced manner across multiple asset classes" to avoid concentrated equity risk in traditional portfolios; traditional portfolios that allocate by capital (e.g. 60% stocks and 40% bonds) tend not to be risk-managed throughout time and rely on strong economic growth environments to generate returns
- built around diversified risk-balanced exposures to Equity Risk, Interest Rate Risk and Inflation Risk; seeks to add return by taking relative-value positions within each asset class, overweighting individual assets that are more attractive and underweighting (or, to a limited extent, shorting) those that we find less attractive
- Expense ratio (adjusted) = 0.98%?

#### Managed Futures

Managed Futures - [$DBMF](https://imgpfunds.com/im-dbi-managed-futures-strategy-etf/)
- This is an actively managed futures ETF that has outperformed the SG CTA Index since inception. It uses long and short positions within derivatives, mostly futures contracts, and forward contracts. These contracts span domestic equities, fixed income, currencies, and commodities. $DBMFI tries to minimize single manager risk by targeting the performance of a diversified pool of managed futures managers while charging only a 0.85% expense ratio.
- From [etftrends.com articles](https://www.etftrends.com/managed-futures-channel/andrew-beer-digs-into-dbmf-performance-ytd/): "DBMF invests across ten different core futures markets: three different equity futures contracts, three different rates futures contracts, two currency futures contracts, and two different commodity contracts. "As a philosophical matter, when we decide what we want to invest in, we believe that market depth and liquidity are really, really valuable, precious things because it allows us to go in and out of positions with virtually no trading costs," Beer explained. "It means that if the cracks underneath the market continue to spread, more liquidity flows into the stuff that we’re trading... When managed futures does the best is when the unexpected or the seemingly impossible keeps happening in markets," Beer said. "We think the diversification argument has really been cemented this year, and there’s no reason to believe that the returns that we’ve realized are going to reverse or even diminish over time just given the market that we’re in."
- But consider that "the fund started with just $65 million in AUM in January and is now closing in on nearly $700 million AUM. The fund had become a strong diversification play for portfolios this year and has offered significant returns (28.99% YTD as of 09/14/22)." Retail has a bad habit of periodically crowding into CTA funds after rare periods of strong performance.
- From the 2022-Q2 review: "First, the consensus shifts radically and often. Just a year ago, few market observers expected any inflation at all – forecasts showed a decade of perpetually low interest rates. Even by mid-August, most expected no rate hikes in 2022; today the debate is between three and four. Second, the broad macro call is only half the battle: predicting how markets respond presents its own challenges. Handed a crystal ball in December 2020 that showed 7% CPI (Consumer Price Index) a year later, who would have expected gold to decline, 10-Year Treasuries to struggle to breach 2%, and commodity-heavy emerging market stocks to underperform global equities by 25%? Third, we think this is just the beginning. That is, we are in a regime shift from a decade of soaring equity and bond prices, deflation, near zero interest rates, and endless monetary easing to something more complicated."
- "During the quarter, the Fund maintained short positions in the EUR and Yen – a bet on faster rate hikes in the US — while also pivoting from short to long gold. Additionally, the portfolio maintained its profitable long position in crude oil and rotated from international developed to large cap US equities.  During the quarter, the Fund outperformed the SG CTA Index by 290 bps."
- From the prospectus: "The fund will employ long and short positions in derivatives, primarily futures contracts and forward contracts, across the broad asset classes of equities, fixed income, currencies and commodities... Fund positions in those contracts are determined based on a proprietary, quantitative model – the Dynamic Beta Engine – that seeks to identify the main drivers of performance by approximating the current asset allocation of a selected pool of the largest commodity trading advisor hedge funds. The Dynamic Beta Engine analyzes recent (i.e., trailing 60-day) performance of CTA hedge funds in order to identify a portfolio of liquid financial instruments that closely reflects the estimated current asset allocation of the selected pool of CTA hedge funds, with the goal of simulating the performance, but not the underlying positions, of those funds. Based on this analysis, the Fund will invest in an optimized portfolio of long and short positions in domestically-traded, liquid derivative contracts. The Dynamic Beta Engine uses data sourced from (1) publicly available U.S. futures market data obtained and cross-checked through multiple common subscription pricing sources, and (2) public CTA hedge fund indexes obtained through common subscription services and cross-checked with publicly available index information. The Fund may have gross notional exposure, which is defined as the sum of the notional exposure of both long and short derivative positions across the Fund, that approximates the current asset allocation and matches the risk profile of a diversified pool of the largest CTAs."

Managed Futures - [$KMLM](https://kfafunds.com/kmlm/): KFA Mount Lucas Managed Futures Index Strategy ETF
- Benchmarked to the KFA MLM Index, which consists of a portfolio of twenty-two liquid futures contracts traded on U.S. and foreign exchanges.

- The Index evaluates market trading signals on a daily basis and rebalances on the first day of the month. In addition, the Index has a target average annualized volatility of 15% over time.

Managed Futures - [$CTA](https://www.simplify.us/etfs/cta-simplify-managed-futures-strategy-etf): Simplify Managed Futures Strategy ETF
- Seeks long term capital appreciation by systematically investing in futures in an attempt to create an absolute return profile, that also has low correlation to equities, and can provide support in risk-off events; invests across US and Canadian commodities and rates; equity futures are excluded to ensure low correlations with equity-dominated portfolios
- $CTA deploys a suite of systematic models that have been designed by Altis Partners, a commodity trading advisor with over 20 years of experience

#### Equity income

$JEPI - [Seeking Alpha](https://archive.is/5QQvh#selection-1227.0-1227.56): JEPI: A 12% Yielding 'Retirement Dream ETF' With A Catch
- JEPI was the 8th most popular ETF of 2022, and its 12% yield, paid monthly, has created a firestorm of investor interest. Since inception, JEPI has delivered an average yield of 9.3% and 13.4% annual returns, but with 37% less volatility than the S&P and with 50% smaller peak declines.
- But: According to management, JEPI is designed to deliver 5% to 8% yield over time, and 6% to 10% annual returns, 85% that of the S&P 500, with 35% lower volatility. In addition, 80% to 85% of JEPI's dividends are taxed as ordinary income, which means as much as 50% of the yield could go to the IRS if owned in a taxable account where the investor is in the highest tax bracket. Rather than 0%, 10%, 15%, 20%, or 23.8% tax rates, as is the case with qualified dividends, just 15% to 20% of JEPI's dividends are qualified.
- JEPI owns 111 companies, some of the best blue-chips on earth. It's a diversified, generally low-volatility portfolio that yields about 2% right now. Its investment team uses a proprietary strategy that ranks the companies that pass its quality screen by earnings and price volatility. This is to maximize volatility-adjusted returns over time.
- JEPI's differentiating strategies: (1) it uses equity-linked notes, or ELNs, instead of standard covered call writing. Most of these contracts are for one week. (2) its ELNs are out of the money, rather than the industry norm of near or in-the-money calls, which tend to be for one month. ELNs are agreements with other institutions that generate income and are a POTENTIALLY superior alternative to covered calls... unless there is a financial crisis and some of its counterparties default on these contracts. Over the past 15 years, the market has averaged about 8% ELN income premiums, including four bear markets and two crashes.
- 15% to 20% of JEPI's portfolio is ELNs that makeup almost all of its income, which is what it pays out as monthly dividends. So 80% to 85% of the portfolio is world-class blue-chips designed to generate returns, while 15% to 20% of the portfolio generates almost all of the income.
- Important: Even a 6.5% yield over time, as management is guiding for, still sounds great. But here's the catch. If you don't reinvest a significant portion of those dividends, your initial investment will lose money over time. For context $XYLD investors who took their dividends in cash have lost 21% of their original investment over the last nine years when adjusting for inflation. To offset this and keep your principle intact, you would have had to reinvest 38% of the dividends. Since inception [June 2020], if you had invested in JEPI and taken your dividends in cash, then even ignoring high taxes, you'd be down 7% when adjusting for inflation; reinvesting 50% of the dividends into more JEPI shares would have kept your principal whole.
- In other words, if you want to avoid your original investment getting eaten away by inflation over time, you should plan to reinvest 50% of the dividends: allocate up to 50% of dividends to taxes (for the top tax bracket), and reinvest the other 50% to keep your principal from eroding.

$JEPI - [Seeking Alpha](https://archive.is/zqjqq): JEPI Is The Name, High Yield Is The Game
- JEPI is well-diversified, with low concentration in its top 10 stock holdings. On average, each position in its top 10 is 1.446% of their overall portfolio. Combined, their top 10 stock holdings make up 14.46% of their total holdings.
- Although JEPI is an income fund, it selects its holdings to maximize risk-adjusted total return and does not select its holdings based on current yield, as most of the distributions paid by JEPI come from selling covered calls.
- JEPI sells “out of the money” call options. This is an important point because it allows JEPI to catch some of the upside if the stock or index gains in price.
One of their closest competitors, Global X S&P 500 Covered Call ETF (XYLD) sells cover calls “at the money,” which provides a larger premium but limits the upside potential.
- JEPI uses Equity-Linked Notes (“ELNs”) as a vehicle to sell cover calls. Equity-linked notes are a type of structured product that combines characteristics of a debt instrument with an underlying equity component, in this case covered calls.
- JEPI may invest up to 20% of the funds’ net assets in ELNs. Again, we don’t know how JP Morgan structures their ELNs, but typically the biggest risk involved in structured products is counterparty default, just like with a regular bond. If the bank('s') issuing the ELN goes bankrupt, then JEPI’s performance would be significantly impacted.
- On average JEPI expects to receive a 1 to 2% yield from dividends on their long positions and a 5 to 8% yield on the option premiums received.

$JEPI - [WSJ](https://archive.is/00dI9#selection-115.5-115.82): Why Investors Are Piling into Funds That Promise Not to Beat the Stock Market
- What if you could earn monthly dividends on stocks at an annual rate of at least 11%? That’s the pitch for exchange-traded funds that are generating eye-popping yields by selling options contracts. These ETFs, known as covered-call or option-income funds, also shielded investors from some of the pounding that stocks took last year.
- Last year, JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF lost 3.5%—far outperforming the dismal 18.1% decline in the S&P 500. No wonder the JPMorgan fund took in $12.9 billion in new money last year—the biggest annual haul for any actively managed ETF ever. Three covered-call funds from Global X, linked to the Nasdaq-100, S&P 500 and Russell 2000 indexes respectively, attracted a combined $5.2 billion in 2022. So far in 2023, approximately $3 billion more has flowed into these four funds alone.
- This week, with the S&P 500 gaining 8% so far this year, JPMorgan’s Equity Premium Income ETF was up just 1%. That trade-off is inevitable. “You’re not going to capture all of the upside in an up market,” says Hamilton Reiner, lead portfolio manager of the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income fund. “You trade away some of that for the bird-in-hand of higher income."
- Tax implications: You could generate a roughly 12% annual “yield” on your stock portfolio simply by selling 1% of your holdings every month. The proceeds would be taxable at the maximum capital-gains rate of about 20% (or would even reduce your tax bill if you sell positions at a loss).
With covered-call funds, on the other hand, dividend distributions can be taxed at ordinary-income rates of up to approximately 40%, whereas stock dividends are typically taxed at half that rate or less.
