### Real estate crowdfunding platforms

Access to specific real estate projects offered at a few real estate crowdfunding platforms like FundRise, CrowdStreet, and YieldStreet.

Ask Google's AI Mode this question to get a decent comparison of these options: _"what are the considerations for an investor thinking of allocating money to fundrise vs crowdstreet vs yieldstreet for real estate exposure? and how do they compare to investing in REIT ETFs?"_

The minimum investment levels at FundRise are pretty low, although higher amounts give you access to more projects. the minimum levels at CrowdStreet and YieldStreet are a bit higher, around $25,000, which might be too high for many people unless they reduce their 401(k) contributions. 

Ssome of these platforms allow you to invest in managed funds (so money is spread across different projects) as well as individual deals (like a specific multi-family residential building or shopping plaza in a certain area). but the minimum investment levels of $10,000 or $25,000 would apply to each deal, which means you're exposed to a lot more risk unless you can diversify across multiple deals. but of course, that's tough because it means allocating at least $100,000 to get some diversification.

Also, these investments have holding periods of at least several years, which means less control / access to your funds, as compared to REIT ETFs, which let you sell anytime (although that might be bad thing for investors who have a bad habit of panic-selling).
