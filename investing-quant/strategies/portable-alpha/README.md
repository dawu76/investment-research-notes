### Portable alpha

Definition from Pimco:

> "Portable alpha is an investment approach that provides target market exposure, while adding the potential for additional return (alpha) through a separate investment strategy. Because the source of alpha is independent of the desired market exposure, it can theoretically be transported to any market exposure, hence the term 'portable alpha.'"

Implementation per Pimco
- Get market exposure via market-linked instruments such as futures or swaps. Due to leverage, these positions require only a small outlay of cash (if any), allowing the manager to both capture the market return and actively manage the bulk of the portfolio’s cash in a liquid strategy.
- This liquid strategy can be an absolute return bond alpha strategy, for example, that can provide additional return.
- As with an auto loan or mortgage, there is a financing cost associated with buying market exposure using futures or swaps. This cost is usually tied to a short-term money market rate. The alpha strategy must outperform this money market rate in order to deliver excess return.
- At PIMCO, we typically back our portable alpha portfolios with actively managed, high quality liquid enhanced cash, absolute return bonds, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) or long-duration bond strategies.

Implementation per Blackrock: There are three key steps to implement a portable alpha strategy.
- First, the investor chooses a target index for their beta exposure.
- Second, the target index is replicated using market-linked instruments. This part of the portfolio requires a small amount of cash in the form of a margin requirement to achieve the exposure, but also comes with a cash financing cost. As a result, there is excess cash to allocate capital.
- The final step is to invest the remaining funds in an alpha source and a cash reserve.

Overall return
- Determined by how much capital is allocated to the alpha source, how much return it generates, the return of the index exposure, and the cost to finance the index exposure

Advantages
- Investors can enhance their portfolios’ return potential without making dramatic alterations to a traditional asset allocation model. They can get full exposure to market beta and then add returns on top of it through the remaining cash.
- Because the cash is invested differently than the target market exposure, investors may gain a diversification advantage, helping to manage portfolio risk.
