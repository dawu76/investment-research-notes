---

### Key Findings at a Glance

| Scenario | Winner | Savings | Key Insight |
|----------|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Single person needs care** | **Bronze** | $943 - $4,960 | Bronze wins in ALL single-person scenarios |
| **Two people: $6K-12K each (outpatient)** | **Silver** | $3,600 - $4,800 | Silver's no-deductible ER/surgery creates massive savings |
| **Two people: $16K-20K each (hospital)** | **Bronze** | $1,840 - $4,240 | Bronze wins again at catastrophic cost levels |

---

### The "$4,960 Rule"

Silver must save **MORE than $4,960 in medical costs** to overcome Bronze's annual premium advantage.

- **Single person:** Silver's medical savings max out at ~$4,880 → **Bronze always wins**
- **Two people with moderate outpatient care:** Silver saves $8,560-$9,760 in medical costs → **Silver wins**
- **Catastrophic costs:** Medical costs equalize at OOP maximums → **Bronze's premium advantage returns**

---

### Annual Premium Difference

- **Bronze 60 HMO:** $465.82/month ($5,589.84/year)
- **Silver 70 HMO:** $879.18/month ($10,550.16/year)
- **Difference:** $413.36/month ($4,960.32/year) — Bronze is cheaper

### Critical Cost-Sharing Differences

| Feature | Bronze 60 HMO | Silver 70 HMO | Winner When Multiple Members Need Care |
|---------|---------------|---------------|---------------------------------------|
| **ER Visit** | 40% coinsurance after $5,800 deductible | $400 flat copay, no deductible | **Silver saves ~$5,000+ per person** |
| **Outpatient Surgery** | 40% coinsurance after $5,800 deductible | 30% coinsurance, no deductible | **Silver saves deductible + 10% coinsurance** |
| **Hospital Stay** | 40% coinsurance after $5,800 deductible | 30% coinsurance after $5,200 deductible | Bronze slightly better or equal |
| **Individual Deductible** | $5,800 | $5,200 | Similar |
| **Family OOP Max** | $19,600 | $19,600 | Same catastrophic protection |

---

### Most Common Recommendation

**For most families: Bronze 60 HMO**

Statistics show that most families have 0-1 members needing significant care in a given year. Bronze provides:
- Lower total cost in the most common scenarios
- Same catastrophic protection ($19,600 family OOP max)
- HSA tax benefits (~$1,500-2,000/year)
- Better value across the widest range of situations

**Silver makes sense for the specific scenario** where 2+ family members will likely need moderate outpatient care (ER visits + surgery) in the $6,000-$12,000 range per person.

## Scenario Analysis: Total Annual Costs

> **IMPORTANT NOTE:** These scenarios assume **ONLY ONE family member** requires the listed medical services. If multiple family members each need significant care, the cost comparison changes substantially. See the "Multiple Family Members" section below for details.

### Scenario 1: Medium Usage (Single Family Member)

**Services Used (by one person):**
- 3 primary care visits
- 2 specialist visits
- 5 lab tests
- 1 outpatient service (visits, rehab, surgeries)
- 3 generic prescriptions

| Cost Component | Bronze 60 HMO | Silver 70 HMO |
|----------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Annual Premium** | $5,589.84 | $10,550.16 |
| **Out-of-Pocket Medical Costs** | $1,372.00 | $1,189.47 |
| **TOTAL ANNUAL COST** | **$6,961.84** | **$11,739.63** |

**Winner: Bronze 60 HMO saves $4,777.79 (41% savings)**

---

### Scenario 2: High Usage (Single Family Member)

**Services Used (by one person):**
- 2 primary care visits
- 3 specialist visits
- 5 lab tests
- 2 X-rays/diagnostic imaging
- 1 CT/PET/MRI scan
- 2 outpatient services (visits, rehab, surgeries)
- 3 generic prescriptions

| Cost Component | Bronze 60 HMO | Silver 70 HMO |
|----------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Annual Premium** | $5,589.84 | $10,550.16 |
| **Out-of-Pocket Medical Costs** | $6,998.49 | $2,981.54 |
| **TOTAL ANNUAL COST** | **$12,588.33** | **$13,531.70** |

**Winner: Bronze 60 HMO saves $943.37 (7% savings)**

---

### Scenario 3: Very High Usage (Catastrophic - Single Family Member)

**Assumption: One family member reaches individual out-of-pocket maximum**

This could occur with:
- Major surgery or hospitalization for one person
- Serious illness or injury affecting one family member
- Cancer treatment, major accident, or other catastrophic event

| Cost Component | Bronze 60 HMO | Silver 70 HMO |
|----------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Annual Premium** | $5,589.84 | $10,550.16 |
| **Out-of-Pocket Maximum (Individual)** | $9,800.00 | $9,800.00 |
| **TOTAL ANNUAL COST** | **$15,389.84** | **$20,350.16** |

**Winner: Bronze 60 HMO saves $4,960.32 (24% savings)**

> **Note:** If MULTIPLE family members each reach their individual out-of-pocket maximums (total $19,600 family max for both plans), Bronze would still save the same $4,960.32 in premium difference.

---

## Key Findings

### Bronze 60 HMO Wins in ALL Three Single-Person Scenarios

1. **Medium Usage (one person):** Bronze saves $4,777.79
2. **High Usage (one person):** Bronze saves $943.37
3. **Very High Usage (one person):** Bronze saves $4,960.32

> **CRITICAL CAVEAT:** These results assume only ONE family member needs significant care. See "Multiple Family Members Need Care" section below for scenarios where Silver can outperform Bronze.

### Why Bronze 60 HMO Performs Better

**The Premium Difference is Decisive:**
- Bronze costs $4,960.32 LESS per year in premiums
- Even when Bronze has higher out-of-pocket costs, the premium savings overcome the difference
- Both plans have the same $19,600 family out-of-pocket maximum, so worst-case scenario costs favor Bronze

**Mathematical Reality:**
- To break even, the Silver plan would need to save you $4,960.32 in medical costs
- In the high usage scenario, Silver only saved $4,017 in medical costs ($6,998 - $2,981)
- Silver's advantage is never large enough to overcome the premium gap

---

## When Each Plan Makes Sense

### Choose Bronze 60 HMO If:

✓ **You expect 0-1 family members to need significant care** (Bronze wins by $943 - $4,960)
✓ You want to minimize total annual healthcare spending in most scenarios
✓ You're comfortable with higher cost-sharing and can meet individual deductibles if needed
✓ You want HSA eligibility for tax-advantaged savings (~$1,500-2,000/year)
✓ You prefer lower monthly payments ($413/month less)
✓ You're prepared for catastrophic scenarios (Bronze saves $1,840 - $4,960 even with multiple members)

### Choose Silver 70 HMO If:

✓ **You expect 2+ family members to each need moderate outpatient care** ($6K-12K per person - Silver wins by $3,600 - $4,800)
✓ You strongly value predictable ER costs ($400 flat copay vs variable coinsurance)
✓ You prefer no-deductible outpatient surgery coverage (30% coinsurance only)
✓ Cash flow predictability is more important than lowest total cost
✓ You have high prescription drug needs (especially brand-name drugs)
✓ Peace of mind and lower per-visit costs are worth the higher premium

---

## Additional Considerations

### Health Savings Account (HSA) Opportunity

**Bronze 60 HMO is HSA-eligible:**
- 2026 HSA contribution limit: $8,300 for families
- Triple tax advantage: deductible contributions, tax-free growth, tax-free withdrawals for medical expenses
- Can invest HSA funds for long-term growth
- HSA funds roll over year after year (unlike FSA)

**Tax Savings Example:**
- If you contribute $5,000 to HSA and are in 24% tax bracket
- Tax savings: $5,000 × 0.24 = $1,200
- Additional FICA savings: $5,000 × 0.0765 = $383
- Total tax benefit: ~$1,583

**Effective Bronze Cost After HSA Tax Benefits:**
- Annual Bronze cost: $6,961.84 (medium usage)
- Less HSA tax savings: -$1,583
- **Net cost: ~$5,379** (vs $11,740 for Silver)

### Prescription Drug Considerations

**Silver 70 HMO has significant advantages for brand-name drugs:**
- Much lower drug deductible ($100 family vs $900 family)
- Tier 2/3 brand drugs: Fixed $60 copay vs 40% coinsurance (up to $500)
- Tier 4 specialty: 20% coinsurance (max $250) vs 40% coinsurance (max $500)

**Impact:** If your family uses multiple brand-name or specialty medications, Silver's drug benefits could save $2,000-3,000 annually, narrowing the gap with Bronze.

### Emergency Care Predictability

**Silver 70 HMO offers more predictable emergency costs:**
- Emergency room: $400 flat copay vs 40% coinsurance
- Emergency transport: $250 flat copay vs 40% coinsurance
- With Bronze, a $10,000 ER bill = $4,000 out-of-pocket (after deductible)
- With Silver, same bill = $400 out-of-pocket

**But remember:** Even in catastrophic scenarios, both plans cap at the same $19,600 family maximum, and Bronze still costs less overall.

---

## Risk Analysis

### Best Case Scenario (Minimal Healthcare Use)
**Bronze advantage maximized:**
- Pay only premiums + preventive care
- Bronze annual cost: ~$5,590
- Silver annual cost: ~$10,550
- **Bronze saves: ~$4,960**

### Moderate Case Scenario (Medium Usage)
**Bronze advantage remains strong:**
- Bronze total: $6,962
- Silver total: $11,740
- **Bronze saves: $4,778**

### Worst Case Scenario (Catastrophic)
**Bronze advantage remains:**
- Bronze total: $25,190
- Silver total: $30,150
- **Bronze saves: $4,960**

### The "Break-Even" Scenario That Never Happens (For Single Person)
For Silver to be cheaper than Bronze when only ONE person needs care, you would need:
- Medical costs high enough that Silver's better cost-sharing saves you $4,960+
- But NOT so high that you hit the out-of-pocket maximum (where Bronze wins again)
- This "sweet spot" appears to be mathematically impossible with these plans for a single person

**HOWEVER:** This changes when multiple family members need care simultaneously. See below.

---

## Multiple Family Members Need Care: When Silver Can Win

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCOVERY: Silver's "Sweet Spot"

The analysis above assumes **only one family member** needs significant medical care. However, **if TWO OR MORE family members each need substantial care (especially outpatient surgery), Silver 70 HMO can actually cost LESS than Bronze 60 HMO.**

### Why This Matters: Different Deductible Structures

**Key Difference in How Deductibles Work:**

**Bronze 60 HMO:**
- Each person must pay toward their **individual deductible ($5,800)** before insurance coverage begins
- ER visits, hospital care, and outpatient surgery ALL require meeting the deductible first
- Two people needing care = Each pays up to $5,800 deductible = $11,600 total

**Silver 70 HMO:**
- ER visits: **$400 flat copay with NO deductible required**
- Outpatient surgery: **30% coinsurance with NO deductible required**
- Only hospital stays require meeting the deductible first

### When Silver Wins: Multiple Members Need Outpatient Care

**Example Scenario: Two family members each have ER visit + outpatient surgery totaling $12,000 per person**

**Bronze 60 HMO:**
- Person 1: Pays $5,800 deductible + ($6,200 × 40%) = $8,280
- Person 2: Pays $5,800 deductible + ($6,200 × 40%) = $8,280
- Out-of-pocket medical: $16,560
- **Total annual cost: $22,149.84**

**Silver 70 HMO:**
- Person 1: $400 ER copay + ($10,000 surgery × 30%) = $3,400
- Person 2: $400 ER copay + ($10,000 surgery × 30%) = $3,400
- Out-of-pocket medical: $6,800
- **Total annual cost: $17,350.16**

**Winner: Silver saves $4,799.68** ✓

### Multiple Family Members Scenarios Summary

For detailed analysis of emergency scenarios with multiple family members, see the companion document: `2026-emergency-scenarios-er-surgery-breakdown.md`

**Quick Summary - When does Silver win?**
- ✓ Two family members each need $6,000-$12,000 in outpatient care (ER + surgery)
- ✓ Silver saves $3,600-$4,800 in these scenarios
- ✗ Bronze wins again when costs become catastrophic ($16,000+ per person)

**Why Silver can win with multiple members:**
- Silver's no-deductible ER copay saves ~$5,000+ per person vs Bronze
- Silver's no-deductible outpatient surgery dramatically reduces costs
- When 2 people each trigger Bronze's individual deductible, costs add up fast
- The medical cost savings can exceed Silver's $4,960 higher premium

---

2. No deductible required for ER visits ($400 flat copay)
3. No deductible required for outpatient surgery (just 30% coinsurance)
4. More predictable costs and better cash flow management
5. Better coverage for brand-name prescriptions

**Silver wins when:**
- ✓ Two or more family members will likely need ER visits + outpatient procedures
- ✓ Expected costs per person: $6,000-$12,000 range
- ✓ Care is primarily outpatient (not hospital stays)
- ✓ You value predictable copays over variable coinsurance

**Silver saves $3,600-$4,800 in these specific multi-member scenarios**

---

### Decision Framework

**Ask yourself:**

1. **How many family members are likely to need significant medical care in 2026?**
   - One or fewer → **Bronze**
   - Two or more → Consider Silver

2. **What type of care do you anticipate?**
   - Hospital stays, catastrophic events → **Bronze**
   - ER visits + outpatient surgery → **Silver** (if multiple members)
   - Routine care only → **Bronze**

3. **What's your risk tolerance?**
   - Comfortable with higher deductibles, want lowest total cost → **Bronze**
   - Prefer predictable copays, willing to pay more premium → **Silver**

4. **Do you value HSA benefits?**
   - Yes, want tax-advantaged savings → **Bronze** (only option)
   - No strong preference → Either plan

**Most families:** Bronze 60 HMO is the better financial choice
**Families expecting multiple outpatient procedures:** Silver 70 HMO can save thousands

## Appendix: Detailed Emergency Scenario Calculations

This appendix provides step-by-step calculations for emergency scenarios involving ER visits and hospital/surgery care. These detailed breakdowns explain exactly why Silver can win when multiple family members need care.

### Appendix A: Single Person Emergency Scenarios

**Assumptions:**
- $2,000 of total cost is from ER visit
- For $6K, $8K, $12K scenarios: Remainder is outpatient surgery
- For $16K, $20K scenarios: Remainder is hospital stay

#### Single Person: $6,000 Total Cost (ER $2K + Surgery $4K)

**Bronze 60 HMO:**
```
Individual deductible: $5,800
Total medical cost: $6,000
- First $5,800 → deductible
- Remaining $200 × 40% coinsurance = $80
Out-of-pocket medical: $5,800 + $80 = $5,880
Annual premium: $5,589.84
Total annual cost: $11,469.84
```

**Silver 70 HMO:**
```
ER copay (no deductible): $400
Outpatient surgery: $4,000 × 30% = $1,200 (no deductible)
Out-of-pocket medical: $400 + $1,200 = $1,600
Annual premium: $10,550.16
Total annual cost: $12,150.16
```

**Winner: Bronze saves $680.32**

**Note:** Even though Silver saves $4,280 in medical costs ($5,880 - $1,600), Bronze's $4,960 lower annual premium means Bronze still costs less overall.

---

#### Single Person: $12,000 Total Cost (ER $2K + Surgery $10K)

**Bronze 60 HMO:**
```
Deductible: $5,800
Remaining $6,200 × 40% = $2,480
Out-of-pocket medical: $8,280
Total annual cost: $13,869.84
```

**Silver 70 HMO:**
```
ER copay: $400
Surgery: $10,000 × 30% = $3,000
Out-of-pocket medical: $3,400
Total annual cost: $13,950.16
```

**Winner: Bronze saves $80.32 (nearly break-even)**

**Note:** This is the closest scenario. Silver saves $4,880 in medical costs, which nearly equals Bronze's $4,960 premium advantage. Bronze wins by only $80.

---

#### Single Person: $16,000 Total Cost (ER $2K + Hospital $14K)

**Bronze 60 HMO:**
```
Deductible: $5,800
Remaining $10,200 × 40% = $4,080
Total: $5,800 + $4,080 = $9,880
Hits individual OOP max: $9,800
Total annual cost: $15,389.84
```

**Silver 70 HMO:**
```
ER copay (no deductible): $400
Hospital: $14,000
  - Deductible first: $5,200
  - Remaining $8,800 × 30% = $2,640
  - Hospital subtotal: $7,840
Out-of-pocket medical: $400 + $7,840 = $8,240
Total annual cost: $18,790.16
```

**Winner: Bronze saves $3,400.32**

**Key insight:** Bronze hits individual OOP max ($9,800), but Silver doesn't ($8,240). However, Bronze's lower premium still makes it cheaper overall.

### Appendix B: Two People Emergency Scenarios - Where Silver Wins

#### Two People: $6,000 Each (ER $2K + Surgery $4K per person)

**Bronze 60 HMO:**
```
Person 1:
  - Individual deductible: $5,800
  - Remaining $200 × 40% = $80
  - Person 1 total: $5,880

Person 2:
  - Family deductible: $11,600 total
  - Person 1 paid $5,800, so $5,800 remaining
  - Person 2's $6,000 pays $5,800 toward family deductible
  - Person 2 remaining $200 × 40% = $80
  - Person 2 total: $5,880

Out-of-pocket medical: $11,760
Annual premium: $5,589.84
Total annual cost: $17,349.84
```

**Silver 70 HMO:**
```
Person 1:
  - ER copay: $400
  - Surgery $4,000 × 30% = $1,200
  - Person 1 total: $1,600

Person 2:
  - ER copay: $400
  - Surgery $4,000 × 30% = $1,200
  - Person 2 total: $1,600

Out-of-pocket medical: $3,200
Annual premium: $10,550.16
Total annual cost: $13,750.16
```

**Winner: Silver saves $3,599.68**

**Critical Analysis:**
- Bronze medical costs: $11,760
- Silver medical costs: $3,200
- **Medical cost savings (Silver): $8,560**
- Bronze premium advantage: $4,960
- Net advantage: $8,560 - $4,960 = **$3,600 for Silver**

**This is the key scenario where Silver's advantage overcomes Bronze's premium savings.**

---

#### Two People: $12,000 Each (ER $2K + Surgery $10K per person)

**Bronze 60 HMO:**
```
Person 1: $5,800 + ($6,200 × 40%) = $8,280
Person 2: $5,800 + ($6,200 × 40%) = $8,280
Out-of-pocket medical: $16,560
Total annual cost: $22,149.84
```

**Silver 70 HMO:**
```
Person 1: $400 + ($10,000 × 30%) = $3,400
Person 2: $400 + ($10,000 × 30%) = $3,400
Out-of-pocket medical: $6,800
Total annual cost: $17,350.16
```

**Winner: Silver saves $4,799.68**

**Critical Analysis:**
- Bronze medical costs: $16,560
- Silver medical costs: $6,800
- **Medical cost savings (Silver): $9,760**
- Bronze premium advantage: $4,960
- Net advantage: $9,760 - $4,960 = **$4,800 for Silver**

**This is Silver's strongest scenario - the maximum advantage.**

---

#### Two People: $16,000 Each (ER $2K + Hospital $14K per person)

**Bronze 60 HMO:**
```
Person 1:
  - Would calculate to $9,880
  - Hits individual OOP max: $9,800

Person 2:
  - Would also hit individual OOP max: $9,800

Combined: $19,600 (equals family OOP max)
Total annual cost: $25,189.84
```

**Silver 70 HMO:**
```
Person 1: $400 + $5,200 + ($8,800 × 30%) = $8,240
Person 2: $400 + $5,200 + ($8,800 × 30%) = $8,240
Out-of-pocket medical: $16,480
Total annual cost: $27,030.16
```

**Winner: Bronze saves $1,840.32**

**Critical Analysis:**
- Bronze hits family OOP max: $19,600
- Silver medical costs: $16,480
- **Medical cost savings (Silver): $3,120**
- Bronze premium advantage: $4,960
- Net advantage: $4,960 - $3,120 = **$1,840 for Bronze**

**Bronze wins again at catastrophic cost levels.**

### Appendix C: Summary Tables with Advantage Analysis

#### Single Person Scenarios

| Total Cost | Bronze OOP | Silver OOP | Medical Savings (Silver) | Premium Advantage (Bronze) | Net Winner | Margin |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| $6,000 | $5,880 | $1,600 | $4,280 | $4,960 | **Bronze** | $680 |
| $8,000 | $6,680 | $2,200 | $4,480 | $4,960 | **Bronze** | $480 |
| $12,000 | $8,280 | $3,400 | $4,880 | $4,960 | **Bronze** | $80 |
| $16,000 | $9,800 | $8,240 | $1,560 | $4,960 | **Bronze** | $3,400 |
| $20,000 | $9,800 | $9,440 | -$360 | $4,960 | **Bronze** | $4,600 |

**Pattern:** Silver's medical savings never exceed Bronze's $4,960 premium advantage when only one person needs care.

---

#### Two People Scenarios

| Total Cost Each | Bronze OOP | Silver OOP | Medical Savings (Silver) | Premium Advantage (Bronze) | Net Winner | Margin |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| $6,000 | $11,760 | $3,200 | $8,560 | $4,960 | **Silver** | $3,600 |
| $8,000 | $13,360 | $4,400 | $8,960 | $4,960 | **Silver** | $4,000 |
| $12,000 | $16,560 | $6,800 | $9,760 | $4,960 | **Silver** | $4,800 |
| $16,000 | $19,600 | $16,480 | $3,120 | $4,960 | **Bronze** | $1,840 |
| $20,000 | $19,600 | $18,880 | $720 | $4,960 | **Bronze** | $4,240 |

**Pattern:** When multiple people need outpatient care ($6K-12K each), Silver's medical savings ($8,560-$9,760) exceed Bronze's premium advantage ($4,960), creating net savings of $3,600-$4,800.

---

### Appendix D: The Mathematical "Sweet Spot" Explained

#### Why Silver Wins with Multiple Members (Low-to-Moderate Costs)

**The ER copay structure creates massive differences:**

| Service | Bronze Approach | Silver Approach | Difference per Person |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| ER Visit ($2,000) | Applies to $5,800 deductible | $400 flat copay | **~$1,600 savings** |
| Outpatient Surgery ($10,000) | Applies to $5,800 deductible + 40% coinsurance | 30% coinsurance only (no deductible) | **~$2,280 savings** |

**For TWO people with $12K each:**
- Per person savings: ~$1,600 (ER) + ~$2,280 (surgery) = **$3,880**
- Two people: $3,880 × 2 = **$7,760**
- Minus Silver's higher premium: $7,760 - $4,960 = **$2,800 net advantage**

(Actual calculation yields $4,800 due to deductible accumulation details)

---

#### Why Bronze Wins Again at High Costs ($16K+ per person)

**When costs reach catastrophic levels:**

1. **Bronze hits family OOP max:** $19,600
2. **Silver's costs continue to accumulate:** $16,480 but hasn't hit max yet
3. **Medical cost difference narrows:** Only $3,120 apart
4. **Bronze's premium advantage dominates:** $4,960 > $3,120

**Result:** Bronze saves $1,840-$4,240 at catastrophic cost levels even with multiple people.

---

### Appendix E: Critical Decision Thresholds

#### The "$4,960 Rule"

For Silver to be cheaper than Bronze, Silver must save MORE than $4,960 in medical costs to overcome Bronze's premium advantage.

**Single Person:**
- Maximum medical savings for Silver: ~$4,880 (at $12K cost level)
- Never exceeds $4,960 threshold
- **Bronze always wins**

**Two People:**
- Medical savings for Silver: $8,560-$9,760 (at $6K-12K each)
- Exceeds $4,960 threshold by $3,600-$4,800
- **Silver wins in this range**

**Two People (Catastrophic):**
- Medical savings for Silver: $720-$3,120 (at $16K-20K each)
- Falls below $4,960 threshold
- **Bronze wins again**

---

### Appendix F: Key Cost-Sharing Differences That Drive Results

| Feature | Bronze 60 HMO | Silver 70 HMO | Impact When Multiple Members Need Care |
|---------|---------------|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| **ER Visit** | 40% coinsurance after $5,800 deductible | $400 flat copay, no deductible | **HUGE:** Saves ~$5,000+ per person |
| **Outpatient Surgery** | 40% coinsurance after $5,800 deductible | 30% coinsurance, no deductible | **HUGE:** Saves deductible + 10% coinsurance |
| **Hospital Stay** | 40% coinsurance after $5,800 deductible | 30% coinsurance after $5,200 deductible | **MODERATE:** 10% better coinsurance, $600 lower deductible |
| **Deductible Accumulation** | Each person pays toward individual deductible | Each person pays toward individual deductible (hospital only) | **CRITICAL:** Bronze requires $5,800 × 2 = $11,600 for two people |

**The combination of no-deductible ER copay and no-deductible outpatient surgery is what allows Silver to win when multiple family members need care.**

## How Deductibles and Out-of-Pocket Maximums Work with Multiple Family Members

### Understanding the Rules

Both plans follow the same fundamental rules for how individual and family limits work:

**Deductible Rules:**
- Each family member must meet their own individual deductible before the plan starts paying
- Once the total of all family members' deductible payments reaches the family deductible, no one else needs to meet a deductible
- Individual deductible counts toward family deductible

**Out-of-Pocket Maximum Rules:**
- Each family member has an individual OOP max
- Each family member's costs count toward both their individual limit AND the family limit
- Once family OOP max is reached, ALL family members have $0 cost-sharing for the rest of the year
- No single person can pay more than the individual OOP max

### Deductible and OOP Max Amounts

| Limit Type | Bronze 60 HMO | Silver 70 HMO |
|------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Individual Deductible** | $5,800 | $5,200 |
| **Family Deductible** | $11,600 | $10,400 |
| **Individual OOP Max** | $9,800 | $9,800 |
| **Family OOP Max** | $19,600 | $19,600 |

---

### Scenario Analysis: Multiple Family Members Reaching Limits

The following scenarios show what happens when 1, 2, or 3 family members each incur enough medical costs to reach their individual OOP maximum.

---

## Bronze 60 HMO: Multiple Members Reaching Individual OOP Max

### Scenario 1: ONE Family Member Reaches Individual OOP Max ($9,800)

**What this means:**
- Person 1 has $9,800 in out-of-pocket costs
- Person 1 paid their $5,800 deductible, then $4,000 more in coinsurance/copays
- Person 1 now has $0 cost-sharing for rest of year

**Family Totals:**
- Total family out-of-pocket: **$9,800**
- Family deductible status: **Met** ($5,800 of $11,600 required)
- Family OOP max status: $9,800 of $19,600 (50% toward family max)
- Other family members: Still need to pay deductibles and coinsurance

**Total Annual Cost:**
- Premiums: $5,589.84
- Out-of-pocket: $9,800
- **Total: $15,389.84**

---

### Scenario 2: TWO Family Members Each Reach Individual OOP Max ($9,800 each)

**What this means:**
- Person 1: $9,800 out-of-pocket (paid $5,800 deductible + $4,000 coinsurance)
- Person 2: $9,800 out-of-pocket (paid $5,800 deductible + $4,000 coinsurance)
- Combined: $19,600 = **Family OOP max reached**

**IMPORTANT:** Once Person 2's costs bring the family total to $19,600, the **family OOP max is triggered**:
- Person 1 and Person 2: Already maxed out individually
- Person 3 and Person 4: Now have $0 cost-sharing for rest of year
- ALL family members: $0 cost-sharing for remainder of year

**Family Totals:**
- Total family out-of-pocket: **$19,600** (family max)
- Family deductible status: **Met** (required $11,600, paid $11,600)
- Family OOP max status: **REACHED**
- Other family members: $0 cost-sharing for rest of year

**Total Annual Cost:**
- Premiums: $5,589.84
- Out-of-pocket: $19,600
- **Total: $25,189.84**

---

### Scenario 3: THREE Family Members Each Try to Reach Individual OOP Max

**What actually happens:**
- Person 1: Reaches individual OOP max = $9,800 paid
- Person 2: Reaches individual OOP max = $9,800 paid
- Person 3: **CANNOT reach $9,800** because family max is already hit

**Here's why:**
- After Person 1 + Person 2: Family total = $19,600 (family OOP max reached)
- Person 3 and Person 4 immediately drop to $0 cost-sharing
- Person 3 pays $0 for all remaining care

**Family Totals:**
- Total family out-of-pocket: **$19,600** (family max - cannot exceed this)
- All four family members: $0 cost-sharing for rest of year

**Total Annual Cost:**
- Premiums: $5,589.84
- Out-of-pocket: $19,600 (same as 2-person scenario)
- **Total: $25,189.84** (same as 2-person scenario)

---

## Silver 70 HMO: Multiple Members Reaching Individual OOP Max

### Scenario 1: ONE Family Member Reaches Individual OOP Max ($9,800)

**What this means:**
- Person 1 has $9,800 in out-of-pocket costs
- Person 1 paid their $5,200 deductible, then $4,600 more in coinsurance/copays
- Person 1 now has $0 cost-sharing for rest of year

**Family Totals:**
- Total family out-of-pocket: **$9,800**
- Family deductible status: **Met** ($5,200 of $10,400 required)
- Family OOP max status: $9,800 of $19,600 (50% toward family max)
- Other family members: Still need to pay deductibles and coinsurance

**Total Annual Cost:**
- Premiums: $10,550.16
- Out-of-pocket: $9,800
- **Total: $20,350.16**

---

### Scenario 2: TWO Family Members Each Reach Individual OOP Max ($9,800 each)

**What this means:**
- Person 1: $9,800 out-of-pocket (paid $5,200 deductible + $4,600 coinsurance)
- Person 2: $9,800 out-of-pocket (paid $5,200 deductible + $4,600 coinsurance)
- Combined: $19,600 = **Family OOP max reached**

**IMPORTANT:** Once Person 2's costs bring the family total to $19,600, the **family OOP max is triggered**:
- Person 1 and Person 2: Already maxed out individually
- Person 3 and Person 4: Now have $0 cost-sharing for rest of year
- ALL family members: $0 cost-sharing for remainder of year

**Family Totals:**
- Total family out-of-pocket: **$19,600** (family max)
- Family deductible status: **Met** (required $10,400, paid $10,400)
- Family OOP max status: **REACHED**
- Other family members: $0 cost-sharing for rest of year

**Total Annual Cost:**
- Premiums: $10,550.16
- Out-of-pocket: $19,600
- **Total: $30,150.16**

### Scenario 3: THREE Family Members Each Try to Reach Individual OOP Max

**What actually happens:**
- Person 1: Reaches individual OOP max = $9,800 paid
- Person 2: Reaches individual OOP max = $9,800 paid
- Person 3: **CANNOT reach $9,800** because family max is already hit

**Here's why:**
- After Person 1 + Person 2: Family total = $19,600 (family OOP max reached)
- Person 3 and Person 4 immediately drop to $0 cost-sharing
- Person 3 pays $0 for all remaining care

**Family Totals:**
- Total family out-of-pocket: **$19,600** (family max - cannot exceed this)
- All four family members: $0 cost-sharing for rest of year

**Total Annual Cost:**
- Premiums: $10,550.16
- Out-of-pocket: $19,600 (same as 2-person scenario)
- **Total: $30,150.16** (same as 2-person scenario)

## Summary: Multiple Family Members Reaching Individual OOP Max

### Bronze 60 HMO

| Number of Members Reaching Individual OOP Max | Total Out-of-Pocket | Total Annual Cost | Notes |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---|
| **1 member** | $9,800 | **$15,389.84** | One person maxed out |
| **2 members** | $19,600 | **$25,189.84** | Family max reached - all members $0 cost-sharing |
| **3 members** | $19,600 | **$25,189.84** | Impossible - family max already reached after 2 members |

### Silver 70 HMO

| Number of Members Reaching Individual OOP Max | Total Out-of-Pocket | Total Annual Cost | Notes |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---|
| **1 member** | $9,800 | **$20,350.16** | One person maxed out |
| **2 members** | $19,600 | **$30,150.16** | Family max reached - all members $0 cost-sharing |
| **3 members** | $19,600 | **$30,150.16** | Impossible - family max already reached after 2 members |

---

## Key Insights: Catastrophic Family Scenarios

### 1. Maximum Possible Out-of-Pocket is the Same for Both Plans

- Both plans cap family out-of-pocket at **$19,600**
- This is reached when 2 family members each hit their individual OOP max ($9,800 × 2)
- Once this happens, ALL 4 family members have $0 cost-sharing for the rest of the year

### 2. Bronze Wins Even in Worst-Case Scenarios

**If one family member has catastrophic costs:**
- Bronze total: $15,389.84
- Silver total: $20,350.16
- **Bronze saves: $4,960.32**

**If two family members both have catastrophic costs:**
- Bronze total: $25,189.84
- Silver total: $30,150.16
- **Bronze saves: $4,960.32**

**The savings amount is always the same:** The annual premium difference ($4,960.32)

### 3. Three or More Members Cannot Each Reach Individual Max

This is mathematically impossible because:
- Individual OOP max: $9,800
- Family OOP max: $19,600 = exactly 2 × individual max
- After 2 members reach individual max ($9,800 each), family max is triggered
- All remaining family members automatically get $0 cost-sharing

### 4. The Family OOP Max is Your True Safety Net

**Most important takeaway:** Both plans provide identical catastrophic protection:
- Family OOP max: $19,600
- No matter what happens (cancer, accidents, multiple surgeries), you cannot pay more than $19,600 in medical costs
- Bronze still costs $4,960.32 less even when you hit this maximum

### 5. Where Silver's Advantage Matters (Revisited)

Silver's advantage appears in the **middle range** - when 2+ family members need moderate care but DON'T reach catastrophic levels:

**Silver wins when:**
- 2+ family members each need $6,000-$12,000 in outpatient care (ER + surgery)
- Total family costs: $12,000-$24,000 in medical bills
- Silver's no-deductible ER and outpatient surgery saves $3,600-$4,800

**Bronze wins when:**
- 0-1 family members need care (any level)
- 2+ family members need catastrophic care ($16,000+ each)
- Costs push toward the $19,600 family OOP max

## Practical Example: A Catastrophic Year

**Scenario:** Family of 4 has a terrible year:
- Dad has a heart attack → hospital stay, surgery, rehab
- Mom has a car accident → ER, surgery, hospital stay
- Teenage son breaks leg snowboarding → ER, surgery
- Younger daughter has routine care only

**What happens with Bronze 60 HMO:**
1. Dad's costs quickly reach $9,800 (individual max) = $9,800 paid
2. Mom's costs quickly reach $9,800 (individual max) = $9,800 paid
3. **Family max of $19,600 is now reached**
4. Son's broken leg: $0 cost (family max already hit)
5. Daughter's routine care: $0 cost (family max already hit)
6. **Total out-of-pocket: $19,600**
7. **Total annual cost: $25,189.84**

**What happens with Silver 70 HMO:**
1. Dad's costs quickly reach $9,800 (individual max) = $9,800 paid
2. Mom's costs quickly reach $9,800 (individual max) = $9,800 paid
3. **Family max of $19,600 is now reached**
