### Introduction

What has changed in the market?
- Absolute costs of investment products are much lower than before, but so are expected returns.
- Easier than before to build a diversified portfolio for low cost, in large part to ETFs. However, active managers control 70%+ of the market.
- Major disadvantage of most ETFs: they're usually market cap-weighted. Other approaches: equal weighting. Related idea: smart beta, halfway between active management and passive tracking of an index.

Goal of book
- To present a 'smart' way to build a portfolio that does not require sophisticated math and theory, but instead relies on "straightforward methods consistent with the right theory" with "simple rules of thumb."

Questions to consider
- Invest in shares directly or ETFs? How many funds to buy?
- How to compare cheaper ETFs and actively managed, higher-fee funds?
- How to compare ETFs? Are smart beta ETFs worth the cost? What are pitfalls of inverse ETFs, leveraged ETFs, currency hedged ETFs?
- Is robo-investing worth it?
- How much to invest in alternative assets?

Key considerations: uncertainty and cost
- Uncertainty: Predicting the future is harder than it seems. Historical returns data is less useful than it seems. Long-term multi-decade trends are important, which can make past data less relevant. What aspects of future returns are more predictable?
- Costs: Take into consideration hidden costs and tradeoffs between costs and potentially higher returns / greater diversification.

### Prologue: What do we know?

What we don't know: future average returns
- Financial markets are highly unstable, prone to bubbles and crashes. They are not a 'stable and self-correcting system.'
- It's not just about predicting future returns, but doing so better than others. Prices already reflect knowledge and viewpoints that are widespread. Can we actually predict the future with a higher success rate than the average market participant?
