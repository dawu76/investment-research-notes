### [Reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1hzd3e9/wrapped_up_my_18th_year_of_trading/): Wrapped up my 18th year of trading

<blockquote>
From high school through my entire working career, I traded. Through continually working additional jobs, aggressively saving, and trading - I hit my primary goal in my late 20's to retire my mom and ensure she was taken care of financially, she had no retirement plan. I became a millionaire before 30 and have continued to compound. I do things like this now because that teacher took the time to share some life lessons with me and it literally changed my life, I hope to help others. I have an undergrad that was stats heavy as was my MBA. Statistics provides a great framework for analyzing the world around us and what you need could easily be learned via ChatGPT).

My general trading approach is discretionary and based on adapting to current market conditions.
- I've maintained a 31.6% CAGR from 2007 to 2024 with the last two years being my top performances, and skewing that metric a bit.
- Removing those, it's mid 20's. I've had two negative years, my first two both down less than 5%.
- My initial philosophy was not to beat the market to the topline every year but minimize my participation in the drawdowns which would allow me to outperform the market.

My options trading approach: Mix of long and short premium ebbs and flows but typically 30-50% of volume is buying with the residual as selling.

I split my portfolio into two broader buckets: Core and Speculative allocation.
- In my core allocation, I typically use a trend following approach in an index (or leveraged) index ETF. This gets the bulk of my capital and I trade a covered strangle typically here.
- The Speculative allocation is much more dynamic and designed to take advantage of whatever the current market conditions are. I generally trade **Ratio Diagonals** (call and put), **short straddles/strangles** (generally for VRP, earnings, and 0DTEs), and long/short single options.

My favorite options trading books: 
- Options as a Strategic Investment,
- Positional Options Trading,
- Volatility Trading,
- Option Volatility & Pricing.

Top 3 things that helped me on my path
1. Creating a written trading plan and demanding that I think through things ahead of time. I wanted to have strategies that would allow me to trade every market condition. I made frameworks to make planning, decision making, and researching more efficient.
2. Planning. From my start as a trader, I spent a lot of time planning my prospective path to help me frame my near-term actions in the context of longer term goals.
3. Paper-trading with two distinct mindsets: 1. Deploying the portfolio as if it was my actual money (because I knew it was going to be) and 2. To test ideas and variations to strategies.

### Follow-up comments

"CS as I trade it is: Long equity, ratio covered calls, cash secured puts: the benefit to trading them together is it builds an enhancing profile for a long equity holding, essentially blending value and dollar cost averaging. the CSPs are used to scale in shares, the ratio covered calls are to offload portions when the underlying is higher. [I own] more shares than short calls to prevent capped upside which is the primary profit mechanism of long equity.
- Strangle vs. straddle: Both approaches consist of buying / selling an equal number of call and put options with the same expiration date. The difference is that the **strangle** has two different strike prices, while the **straddle** has a common strike price.
- Note: "because the options are out-of-the-money in a covered **strangle**, the impact of time erosion is generally _more linear_ for a covered strangle than for a covered straddle, which experiences less time erosion initially and more time erosion as expiration approaches."

"What ratio do you apply for CC? And do you have a stop loss on the equity in case it tanks badly?"
- The ratio really depends on my expectation of the underlying. In general, less than 50% short to long.
- For the equity, it also depends on the holding. Sometimes no stop with the expectation of scaling in during contractions and playing a longer-term idea. Other times I will take risk down using TA [technical analysis] to sidestep the contraction.

"I am also interested in how you think about assignment of the CSP, is this a way to add on/accumulate/reduce basis?"
- I typically maintain both short legs simultaneously but not always. it's more based on the market conditions. sometimes i'll target specific strikes that have **elevated relative IV**. Sometimes I'll target areas where I want to add or offload shares. CSPs are out to gain exposure to "put vol skew" and VRP, as well as to scale into the position, unless I choose to roll and pursue another basis.
