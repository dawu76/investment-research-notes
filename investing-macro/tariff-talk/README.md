### [Mish Talk](https://mishtalk.com/economics/trump-sets-a-huge-tariff-sucker-trap-for-taiwan-and-its-chip-industry/): Trump Sets a Huge Tariff Sucker Trap for Taiwan and its Chip Industry [2025-04-06]

> “You know, we’re no different than an insurance company. Taiwan doesn’t give us anything,” says Trump.

That is how economic illiterates think. Given illiterates are in charge, Taiwan needs to reconsider the deal to expand here because it’s turned into a trap. Trump will have no use for Taiwan if and when full scale production is here.

The US needs Taiwan’s chips. And that is why Trump made an exception to chips. Taiwan should politely tell Trump to go to hell. That’s the only way Taiwan keeps its insurance policy against an invasion by China.

[NY Times](https://archive.is/Te8qG#selection-507.0-507.61): Trump’s Tariffs Don’t Apply to Chips, but Taiwan Remains Wary [2025-04-05]

Semiconductors are a complicated target for tariffs because the supply chain for making them is both global and extremely specialized. While most advanced chips are manufactured in Taiwan, many are then sent to another country like Malaysia for testing. Next, the chips might be put into iPhones or artificial intelligence servers in Mexico or China before those devices are sold to people all over the world.

“Very few semiconductors are actually directly imported into the United States; most are incorporated into a final product,” said Jimmy Goodrich, a senior adviser for technology analysis at the RAND Corporation.
Martin Chorzempa, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, added: “It’s much more tricky than saying, ‘We are going to slap a tariff on steel.’" ... “Any chip that’s made in Arizona right now will have to leave the U.S. for some time before going back,” Mr. Ho said. “It’s just a fact of the global chip supply chain right now.”

Mr. Trump on Wednesday announced a 32 percent tariff on Taiwanese goods exported to the United States, where Taiwan directly sends nearly a quarter of its exports. Besides chips, which will not be taxed, Taiwan mainly exports electronic devices and components for them.

The Taiwanese government “thought too optimistically about the relationship with Trump,” said Jason Hsu, a senior fellow at Hudson Institute and former member of Taiwan’s legislature for the opposition Nationalist Party. “It was a little bit too naïve thinking Trump would be nice to them, especially after the TSMC announcement.”

[NY Times](https://archive.is/mlNym): How Trump’s Tariffs Are Hitting One Chinese Factory Owner: ‘We Are Helpless’ [2025-04-01]

One of her customers, who sells toy dolls based on characters from a book, recently asked for a 20 percent price cut — something Ms. Liao said she could not accommodate. She makes a 30 percent profit margin on the goods she produces, a cushion that allows for the fluctuation of costs for material and labor. Such a steep cut in prices would wipe out most of her profit, making it difficult to continue operating, Ms. Liao said.
Still, it wasn’t easy for her to say no. Last year, that customer ordered 25,000 toy dolls, one of the biggest single orders Ms. Liao received. This year, overall orders are down nearly 30 percent, she said.

Erica Campbell’s Phoenix-based company, Be a Heart, has been a client of Ms. Liao’s since the beginning. Ms. Campbell’s orders for Jesus and Mary dolls have made up one-tenth of Ms. Liao’s work.
In that time, Ms. Liao and Ms. Campbell, 36, each gave birth to their first children. Their personal lives have become intertwined with conversations about business collaborations and product designs ... A few months ago, Ms. Liao messaged Ms. Campbell to tell her that business was really slow, weighed down by the worsening trade tensions between China and the United States. She was trying to figure out how to keep things afloat. In response, Ms. Campbell shared her own challenges. “I’m flailing,” Ms. Campbell wrote back. One of her employees had just left unexpectedly and Ms. Campbell had recently given birth to her third child. “Motherhood is kicking my butt,” she said.

Then she had an idea. Ms. Liao could take over some of the work that the employee had been doing, sourcing materials and communicating with other factories in China. “She did it so well,” Ms. Campbell said.

For now, Ms. Campbell plans to shoulder most of the tariffs and pass some of the cost on to her customers. But if tariffs go above 20 percent, she said, she will have to talk to Ms. Liao about what to do next.
It will be a difficult conversation. Ms. Campbell said she didn’t feel comfortable asking her Chinese partner to take on costs that Ms. Liao had no control over.

“We are often dealing with the same small-business stressors and have had to navigate so much,” Ms. Campbell said. “People like to create this divide, but we are the same and were just born in different countries.”
To Ms. Liao, if everyone raises their costs to soften the blow of tariffs, it could lead to a situation she would prefer not to confront: “We may not be able to serve American customers.”

[guardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/08/wall-street-trump-tariffs): Wall Street traders on Trump tariffs: ‘Without doubt, we’re hitting a recession’ [2025-04-08]

“The markets opened down a lot, then there was a rumor that the tariffs were off, and they went back up, then all bets were off again and it went down,” said Steve Kos of Option Circle, who offered a series of trading day comparisons as he walked out on to Broad Street in lower Manhattan. “You’d have to go back to 2020 with Covid, when people thought the world was going to end. Prior to that it was 2008.”

But Jay said “everything” they saw was about Trump’s relationship with China. The administration, he said, “was trying to get everyone onboard so they can box China out. I think they’re saying, look, we will drop the tariffs on you, but you have to tariff China. “Everything is about China. Everything. It’s not about lumber or fentanyl, it’s about China. Greenland is 100% about China – and Russia, to a degree. Panama is about China. This is all about slowing China down." But, he said, no one was anticipating that the US was looking to become an insulated, self-sustaining nation. “Nobody wants that. They just want it more fair,” he said. “Now we’re $37tn in debt and it needs to be rejigged, but he [Trump] is trying to do it in a shock-and-awe fashion. It could be months or years before we know whether he’s successful or not … but obviously it’s going to take some pain. “The question is, how much pain can our economy and stock market take for the good things to happen? If it’s one or two weeks of sell-offs, we can stomach that, but if it’s months, the congressmen facing election next year are going to squeal …”

The market swings, said Stephen, another trader, showed that “no one knows what’s going on. We don’t know. The swing came out of nowhere, so what was that? Then the market falls out of bed. And then you read fake news. I mean, who put that up? A mistake? Ah, I don’t know.” Asked if we are all in Donald Trump’s hands, the trader said: “You’ve got to hope he has a gameplan he’s not disclosing. That’s where I lay my hope. In actuality, it’s very scary. It’s a scary time right now.”

A technical analyst, Anthony, a veteran of Wall Street since 1997, said the volatility in trading was being determined by Trump’s comments, that were in turn triggering automated trading algorithms to move the markets “like a rubber band”. He analyst said retail investors had not even begun selling off yet, “but it’s coming”. “What’s happening is that it’s going to hit the American people, and they’re going to keep their wallet closed in their pocket. Without a doubt, we’re hitting a recession,” he said. But would the traders still make money? “You bet. You can make more in a down market than up market.” But ultimately, he said, Donald Trump is not for ever. “We might be under the mercy of him right now, but just like the World Trade Center, the 70s oil embargo, [Alan] Greenspan with Long-Term Capital Management – all these things happen. It’s a blip. He’s going to come and he’s going to go. “He’s going to try to push everything he can through now, before the midterms. It’s going to blow up in his face, cause a recession, and any president that causes a recession never gets re-elected – and nor does his party.”
