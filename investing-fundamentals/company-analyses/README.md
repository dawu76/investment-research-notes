[Seeking Alpha: Cavanaugh Research](https://archive.is/41yF0): Meta's Q4 Earnings Preview: What You Need To Know
- Assuming the average analyst consensus estimate as a benchmark, it is suggested that Meta's Q4 sales may decrease by around 6.1% compared to the same quarter in 2021. Additionally, analysts have provided EPS estimates ranging from $1.41 to $2.66, with an average of $2.21, which would indicate a year-over-year decline of almost 40%!
- One potential source for upside could be anchored on a recovery in digital advertising. Investors should consider that macro conditions, or at least sentiment and expectations, have materially improved in Q4 2022 as compared to Q3 2022 - with leading banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) now expecting a softish landing. Notably, going into Q2 and Q3 reporting, some advertising players, notably Snap Inc. (SNAP) warned investors about the deteriorating advertising environment. But we have not heard any such warning from any player going into Q4. Investors should also not fail to disregard implications from the China reopening on advertising - as a bullish macro driver for the global economy.
- Martin Sorrell's comments: "I think that is the big thing here [the reopening of China]. And remember... Alphabet/ Google, Amazon, Meta, there second biggest profit centers have historically been outbound Chinese -- Chinese companies targeting business abroad."
- According to Meta's projections, the negative impact of foreign currency on year-over-year total revenue growth in the fourth quarter was estimated to be around 7%, based on current exchange rates at the time of guidance. Since then, however, the U.S. Dollar Index has depreciated materially - by almost 8%!
