### Cross-asset carry as the slope of yield curve

- Carry can be defined as return for unchanged market prices and is easy to calculate in real time across assets. Carry strategies often reap risk premia and implicit subsidies. Historically, they have produced positive returns in FX, commodities, bonds and equity. Carry strategies can also be combined across asset classes to render diversification benefits. Historically, since 1990, the performance of such diversified carry portfolios has been strong, with Sharpe ratios close to 1, limited correlation to benchmark indices and less of a downside skew that FX carry trades.
- 'Carry' is the return that an investor enjoys if all market conditions, including the asset’s price, **remain the same**. It measures the value appreciation that accrues to the owner of an asset if there is **no expected or unexpected** price change: total return is the sum of carry, expected price appreciation and unexpected price shock.

Allocation based on behavior of futures markets
- Assets that exhibit a term structure of futures in **backwardation** [downward sloped futures price curve] should generate a **positive roll yield** and therefore a **positive excess return** when market conditions remain unchanged. These assets should therefore be generally **over-weighted** in a carry portfolio.
- Assets that exhibit a term structure of futures in **contango** [upward sloped futures price curve] should generate a **negative roll yield** and therefore a **negative excess return** when market conditions remain unchanged. These assets should therefore be generally **under-weighted** in a carry portfolio.”
- When the market conditions remain unchanged, the term structure does not move at all and therefore the entirety of asset return is the **roll yield**. Evidently, carry is just the **slope of the futures curve**."
