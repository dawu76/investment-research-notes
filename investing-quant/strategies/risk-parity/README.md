#### Risk Parity + other strategies

Risk Parity + Trend Following
- From the AllocateSmartly [blog post](https://allocatesmartly.com/taa-strategy-combining-risk-parity-trend-following/): "TAA Strategy Combining Risk Parity & Trend Following"
- This is a combination of two strategies: trend-following (to determine what assets to hold) and risk parity (to determine how much of each asset to hold), to produce one of the least volatile strategies [that we track](https://allocatesmartly.com/list-of-strategies/)
- This post covers two versions of the strategy: the first focused on the US, and the second on global markets.
- Results: Relative to a 60/40 benchmark or equal-weighted benchmark, this strategy results in considerably higher Sharpe & Sortino ratios and much lower max drawdowns over the backtest period.
- AllocateSmartly can be used to follow and track this strategy in near real-time.
