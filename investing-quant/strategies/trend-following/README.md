### On trend-following performance

[AQR](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/White-Papers/Trend-Following-Why-Now-A-Macro-Perspective): "Trend-Following: Why Now? A Macro Perspective"
- "Both the macroeconomic picture and empirical evidence, however, suggest that strong performance for trend-following may persist, making it a potentially valuable source of diversifying returns during a challenging time for the rest of investors’ portfolios."
- "given the backdrop of persistently high inflation, a rapid and resolute shift in central banks’ policies, and the unexpected war in Ukraine, macroeconomic volatility is on the rise. As we would expect, this rise in macroeconomic volatility has also been accompanied by larger market moves and  improved trend-following performance. So far in 2022, market moves are significantly larger than average, and the SG Trend Index is on track for its best annual return since its inception in 2000, as shown in Figure 3. The current environment provides out-of-sample evidence that the relationship between large market moves and trend performance remains intact."
- "At their core, trend-following strategies capture the tendency of markets to gradually incorporate new information. This tendency creates persistent price trends, which may allow trend-following to be profitable on average. Notably, large market drawdowns and crises generally tend to have identifiable 
catalysts and to evolve gradually (e.g., GFC, 2022), which explains why trend-following strategies tend to perform particularly well in such environments. There is a direct relationship between macroeconomic volatility and the size of market moves, with the latter strongly (and intuitively) associated with trend￾following performance."
- "There is no tendency for trend-following strategies to perform worse than average following periods of extremely strong performance."

"This paper seeks to establish whether the strong performance of trend following is a statistical fluke of the last few decades or a more robust phenomenon that exists over a wide range of economic conditions. Using historical data from a number of sources, we construct a time series momentum strategy back to 1880 and find that the strategy was consistently profitable over the next 110 years."
- [paper](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/White-Papers/A-Half-Century-of-Macro-Momentum): A Half Century of Macro Momentum. "Macro momentum – a systematic global macro strategy that takes long positions in assets for which fundamental macroeconomic trends are improving and short positions in assets for which fundamental macroeconomic trends are deteriorating – has the potential to deliver strong positive returns with low correlation to traditional asset classes across various macroeconomic and market environments, including the potential to provide important diversification benefits in bear equity markets and rising yield environments."

### CTA vs. Global Macro

---

Global macro strategy definitions
- This is a flexible strategy whose positions are based on views regarding the economic and geopolitical prospects of various countries. These views are informed by interest rates, politics, domestic and foreign poilcies, international trade, currency exchange rates, etc.
- Holdings may include long and short positions in various equity, fixed income, currency, commodities, and futures markets. The funds may take directional or relative value bets.

3 primary types of global macro funds
- discretionary global macro: in these funds, the PMs take a high-level view of global markets and allocate funds to asset classes accordingly in a flexible, discretionary manner
- CTAS: these funds rely primarily on trend-following algorithms to go long or short different assets (commodities, currencies, etc.)
- systematic global macro: these funds blend a discretionary and CTA-based approach
