> It has been known since at least the 1950s that a more efficient portfolio can be constructed by diversifying across as many sources of return as possible, and scaling exposure to this diversified portfolio using leverage to achieve one’s target return.
>
> This concept is called "Modern Portfolio Theory." To enjoy the greatest amount of expected portfolio growth with the lowest volatility, an investor should invest in an optimally diversified portfolio, and scale exposure to the portfolio using leverage to achieve the required return.

> But the fact is, most investors do not have access to borrowing at rates that make leverage attractive. And many of those who do have access are constrained by regulations, or have a behavioral aversion to leverage. New products launched in the last few years allow individual investors access to efficient leverage and alternative sources of return, and we’re seeing an acceleration in adoption. I expect this trend to continue as returns to 60/40 struggle in the more complicated environment we’re facing in the next decade or so. 

Key concept: "Risk parity is about diversity and balance."
- Diversity, in a portfolio context, is about owning investments that are designed to respond in different ways to various types of economic shocks.
- Think about economic shocks is along the axes of inflation and growth. Different asset classes thrive in different conditions.
- Balance: a simple portfolio that holds equal weight in stocks and bonds is not well balanced because stocks are much more volatile than bonds; a portfolio that has 50% stocks and 50% in bonds has over 90% of its risk coming from stocks. To create a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds you would have to hold about 80% of capital in bonds and just 20% in stocks.

Example of how risk parity uses leverage to achieve a target return
- Given: $100 to invest, borrowing rate = 2%, portfolio return and volatility = 4%, 6%
- Borrow $50 so that we have a total of $150 to invest
- Investing that $150 in the portfolio yields 1.5 * 4% return = 6% return, 1.5 * 6% volatility = 9% volatility
- Borrowing cost = $50 * 2% = 1% cost ($1)
- Net return = 6% - 5% = 5%, volatility = 9%
