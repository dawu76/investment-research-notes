### On risk-tolerance and the ability to stick to investment strategies

From the [paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4318157): "A Century of Asset Allocation Crash Risk" [2023]
- Reliance on extended historical data is associated with the lower probability of early abandonment of the strategy and with the higher cumulative returns. However, only risk-tolerant investors in our study are able to capture the full extent of the benefit of information that is made available to them. 
- Risk-tolerant and well-informed investors about possible drawdowns investors achieve significantly better results when they use extended historical sample developing their prior beliefs about possible investment outcomes. They almost never abandon their investment strategy, ride the market in and out of the crisis, and enjoy attractive full-period returns. On the contrary, investors who exhibit risk-neutral or risk-averse behavior, as well as those who rely on short-term history in developing their investment beliefs, easily exit and lose their investment opportunities. Furthermore, performance of Risk Parity and Dynamic portfolios relies most heavily on the extent of information available to investors in all investment horizons and regardless of their risk preferences.
- We also study the effect of the opportunity to re-enter the investment strategy once market uncertainty settles and find the overwhelming evidence that the re-entry option improves investment outcomes. However, adherence to the strategy during the entire anticipated investment period is still superior to exit and re-entry in most cases.

### Alternative strategies as "complicated wrappers" for varying levels of stock exposure

From the CFA Institute [post](https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2023/07/24/when-hindsight-becomes-foresight-replicating-investment-performance/), "When Hindsight Becomes Foresight: Replicating Investment Performance"
- "Most of the products described in more than 300 research papers [spanning dozens of public and private market investment strategies, such as merger arbitrage and private equity] simply provide exposure to the stock market in complicated wrappers. Once the tide goes out, the risk exposure is the same everywhere."
- We can demonstrate this phenomenon in different ways. The most common approach is to simply run a factor exposure analysis. But there is an even simpler and perhaps more powerful way to illustrate this point: by using a combination of the S&P 500 and cash to replicate the historical performance of an investment product with the same level of risk.
- We analyzed the iMGP DBi Hedge Strategy ETF (DBEH), which tracks the 40 leading long–short equity hedge funds, and found that an 81% allocation to the S&P 500 and a 19% allocation to cash would have delivered almost the same performance with the same volatility. A more comprehensive version of this study would be based on the HFRX Equity Hedge index, which has 20 years of history. The HFRX Equity Hedge Index’s volatility was 6.1% over the 2003 to 2023 period, which we could have replicated with a 52% allocation to the S&P 500 and 49% to cash. But the replication portfolio’s CAGR would have been 3.7% compared with 2.0% for the hedge funds, and the drawdown would have fallen from 31% to 19%. This results in significantly higher risk-adjusted returns for the replication portfolio. Given that an S&P 500 ETF today has basically zero expenses, while hedge funds come with high management and performance fees, who wouldn’t favor the replication portfolio?
- "Given the 0.71 correlation between the HFRX Equity Hedge Index and the S&P 500, there is little question that long–short equity hedge funds offer diluted equity exposure. Furthermore, the HFRX index’s upside beta to the S&P 500 was 0.16 compared with 0.25 on the downside. As such, equity hedge funds follow falling stocks more than rising ones."
