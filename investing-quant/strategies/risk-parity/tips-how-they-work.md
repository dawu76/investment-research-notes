### Treasury Inflation-Protected Bonds: Basics

#### TIPs auctions

"When a TIPS has a real yield of 0.125% or higher, the Treasury always sets the coupon rate to the 1/8% below the real yield … 0.125%, 0.250%, 0.375%, 5.000%, 0.625% … and so on. A real yield of 0.630% gets a coupon rate of 0.625%, and the price is set at a very small discount to par. A real yield of 0.620% gets a coupon rate of 0.500%, and the price gets a bigger discount."

What are the different numbers mentioned in Treasury auction results?

| term                           | definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | example                  |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| high yield                     | The TIPS’ official **real yield to maturity** in the auction records. It is the highest yield the Treasury had to grant to complete the $17 billion offering of this TIPS, and it is the real yield granted to all **non-competitive** bidders (e.g. buyers at brokerages)                                      | 0.630%                   |
| coupon rate                    | Set by Treasury after the auction determines the "real yield to maturity" or the "high yield". Set to 1/8% below this real yield. The coupon payments each year are calculated as: (coupon rate) x (inflation-adjusted principal) = (coupon rate) x (par value of principal) x (index ratio at time of payment) | 0.625%                   |
| unadjusted price               | the discounted price derived from the highest yield accepted in the auction ("high yield"). The auctions determine the high yield, and the unadjusted price is the discounted price to $100 of par value required to get that high yield                                                                        | $99.9517.                |
| cost of par value              | equal to `(par value) x (unadjusted price)`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | $15,000 x (99.9517/100). |
| index ratio on settlement date | equals `reference CPI on settlement date) / (reference CPI on issue date)`. This value will be just slightly above 1.0. This ratio affects the $ amount of purchased principal paid by investor. It also affects the small interest adjustment for the N days between issue and settlement dates.               | 1.00495                  |
| adjusted price                 | equals `(unadjusted price) x (index ratio on issue (settlement) date)`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | $99.9517 x 1.00495       |
