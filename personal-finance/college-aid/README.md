the financial aid is usually like a sliding scale, so even if your income is above the threshold, you can get part of the costs covered.

*BUT* those big announcements about free tuition for incomes less than $150K or $200K ignore one big thing -- the schools do not actually just use income to decide how much financial aid to give. 

they also look at overall household assets, so if you make less than $200K but more than "typical assets" for a family that makes that much, then you will still have to pay part of the tuition.

there are some discussion threads talking about what 'typical assets' means. it doesn't seem possible to find out for sure unless you actually apply yourself or talk to a recent applicant.

this was a good discussion thread about how colleges use your household assets to determine financial aid.

it turns out some of the bigger schools like Harvard have "net price calculators" that estimate what your family's contribution would be based on the annual income + assets you specify.

after playing with these calculators, i have to say, the big news headlines about "free tuition for families making under $X" are sort of dishonest. it's just marketing for the schools.

the schools say that if your income falls below the threshold, then you'll get free tuition if your family has "typical assets". but the threshold for typical assets is so low. for example, the Columbia financial aid FAQ says, "For families with an income of $100,000, we would consider typical assets to be approximately $250,000." 

that's very low! they pretty much require you to NOT have any assets outside of your home and retirement accounts. if you saved wisely over your working years or if you own part of a business (like an auto repair shop or medical office), that's counted against you and heavily penalizes you in the financial aid calculations.

even if you have very low income, any assets in your bank, non-retirement brokerage account, or your business will cause your tuition payments to increase a lot. 

if you play with Harvard's Net Price Calculator tool, you get these estimated financial aid numbers

income: $50K, parent assets: $0 --> student pays $3,500
income: $50K, parent assets: $100K --> student pays $3,500
income: $50K, parent assets: $200K --> student pays $7,000
income: $50K, parent assets: $300K --> student pays $10,500
income: $50K, parent assets: $400K --> student pays $14,000
income: $50K, parent assets: $500K --> student pays $17,500
income: $50K, parent assets: $750K --> student pays $26,250
income: $50K, parent assets: $1M --> student pays $35,000
income: $100K, parent assets: $0 --> student pays $3,500
income: $100K, parent assets: $100K --> student pays $3,500
income: $100K, parent assets: $200K --> student pays $7,000
income: $100K, parent assets: $300K --> student pays $10,500
income: $100K, parent assets: $400K --> student pays $14,000
income: $100K, parent assets: $500K --> student pays $17,500
income: $100K, parent assets: $750K --> student pays $26,250
income: $100K, parent assets: $1M --> student pays $35,000

i copy / pasted the data above into one of the LLMs and asked it to plot it for me. 

basically, even if your household income is very low ($50K for a family of 4, which is not much above poverty level in many parts of CA), your expected tuition payment still goes up as your household assets go up.

a school like Harvard can say, 'our degree is so valuable that you should be thankful that you're getting a discount.' which might be true, but still, the reality is very different from the idea that tuition is $0, even for low-income households.

so if your income is as low as $50K, but you have $500K in assets that you need to preserve (because it's part of your business, or because you're disabled and living off of the interest income), then you still have to take out a loan to pay for college.

need less than those thresholds for both income and assets to qualify for free tuition.

the example was for Columbia specifically; their free tuition upper income threshold is $150K if you have "typical assets".

but according to their website:

"Parentsâ€™ assets include cash, savings, investments, home equity, other real estate equity, and business equity. Retirement assets are not included in our financial aid analysis. For families with total calculated income up to $150,000, we consider typical assets are those up to approximately $250,000." 

so it's also a policy that seems more generous than it really is, because in their assets calculation, they include equity in your home and business.

if you own a home in an expensive area, your home equity will definitely be more than $250K, especially if you're old enough to have college age kids. and if you own a business that generates enough income for you to raise a family, then its value will also push your asset value up beyond that asset value threshold.

if either of those conditions is true, then you'll need to pay a portion of the tuition costs.

it's only a very specific demographic profile that can get free tuition from these colleges: a wage slave who didn't save at all for the future, or whose savings are entirely in their retirement accounts.

for med schools, it's possible that it really is tuition-free regardless of income. 

like NYU's med school recently announced a similar policy. on their website, they say: 

"Every student admitted into the MD program at NYU Grossman School of Medicine automatically receives a scholarship to cover the full cost of our medical school tuition. No application is necessary to receive the Full-Tuition Scholarship."

the fact that it's awarded without the need for applications likely means that they don't even look at your household income.
