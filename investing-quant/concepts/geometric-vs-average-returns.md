### Geometric vs. average returns

- There are two main reasons why [geometric rebalancing] hasn’t been implemented in any widespread capacity yet. The first is psychological. Rebalancing costs were the second, and more important reason. Let’s explore through the lens of Shannon’s Demon.
- Shannon’s Demon works best under three conditions: (a) The assets are volatile. The more volatile the better. (b) The assets are not correlated. Uncorrelated is ok. Negatively correlated is best. Shannon used cash in his example which is always uncorrelated. (c) Rebalancing doesn’t cost anything.
- This explains the historical lack of adoption: (a) "There are only so many uncorrelated assets to choose from. Shannon’s Demon can work with anything that is not 100% correlated, but the more correlated the assets, the smaller the benefit." (b) Most traditional assets are not that volatile. Stocks can be volatile, but normally they don’t bounce much from day to day. The lack of volatility constrains the overall benefit as well. However the benefit still exists. (c) "Finally, rebalancing a portfolio certainly isn’t free. There are always transaction costs. And through most of history, these transaction costs were so high they overwhelmed any benefit frequent rebalancing provided."

[Breaking the Market](https://breakingthemarket.com/the-arithmetic-return-doesnt-exist/): The Arithmetic Return Doesn’t Exist. It’s a dream that isn’t real.
- Each repetition of volatility chews away at its foundation until its dissolves into the geometric return.
- "As time continues on, the likelihood of your path achieving the arithmetic return nears closer and closer to zero. You only get one “sample”. Time is going to win and that one sample isn’t going to “find” the arithmetic return, just like a sample wasn’t going to find the lottery’s arithmetic return ... With enough time the arithmetic return becomes pure luck. It’s theoretically possible to receive the arithmetic return, but you need to get lucky. You are betting on flipping a lot more heads than tails. This is possible but unlikely, and you only get one play."
- "The law of large numbers works against you here. We’ve been taught that with more trials, the sample moves closer towards the “average”. But which average in this case?1 What if you play this game in series? Three 50 flip games in a row is the same as the 150 game. The likelihood of receiving the average return at 150 flips is worse than at 50 flips. Playing the games more often, one after each other doesn’t make the arithmetic average more likely. It makes it less likely."
- "A 'sample' taken from multiple compounded coin flips is very, very unlikely to “find” the arithmetic return. It’s far more likely that it tracked toward the geometric return."
