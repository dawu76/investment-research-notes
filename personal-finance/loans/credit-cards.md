## Credit card bonus tips

### [NY Times](https://archive.is/CsGMH): How Churners Earn Money [2025-10-11]

> Each sign-up bonus is small, so to make a decent income, Mr. Palm keeps applying. During the seven years he has been into this side hustle, he estimates, he and his wife have opened more than 50 cards.
The promotional bonuses have netted his family more than $40,000, he said ... Mr. Palm doesn’t consider himself an extreme churner. While he has opened more than 50 cards over seven years, he knows of others who open 20 cards annually. Some people have been at it for decades.

> Isaac Khor, a doctoral student at Northeastern University, has been opening credit cards since the start of the pandemic. “I’m up 15 grand this year,” he said. “Ph.D. stipends are not that high, so this actually does dramatically augment my income.”
>
> “It’s a hobby for people that enjoy reading the fine print,” Mr. Khor said. A typical churner loves squeezing the last dollar out of every deal, even if that requires several hours of spreadsheet management each week.

> Lindsay Ash started churning 15 years ago, opening credit cards for herself and her husband. The couple, who live in California, have roughly 60 active cards.
“The amount you can eke out of it is ridiculous,” she said. “I still have ‘pinch myself’ moments all the time.” In addition to the cash — five figures each year, she said — her churning supports annual vacations to Japan, Florida and Hawaii.

> Max Gunara, a 30-year-old business owner, estimates that credit card companies and airlines lose $30,000 to $50,000 a year on his perks and bonuses. While he pays $15,000 in annual fees on his personal and corporate cards, he earns roughly 3.3 points per dollar of spending. Because he owns several businesses, his expenses are in the low seven figures. “I have 41 credit cards and I want to say 19 million points that I’m sitting on at the moment,” Mr. Gunara said. He observed that for every person trying to optimize rewards, there were “10 to a hundred” others who didn’t take advantage of the benefits on their high-fee cards.

> Some cards also offer a zero percent interest rate for the first 12 months as a sign-up bonus. Mr. Gunara used one such card to borrow $76,000 interest free, before paying off the balance soon before it was due.
“In today’s interest rate environment, that is the cheapest form of business credit you can get,” he said.

> Some people go even further. Cardholders earn cash back when they rack up huge balances, so they are often on the lookout for manufactured spending, or loopholes that allow users to build expenses without actually 
spending money.

> “Back in the day, it was possible to order dollar coins from the Mint and pay for them” with a card to earn a sign-up bonus, Ms. Ash, the churner from California, said. Other techniques include buying gift cards, overpaying taxes and purchasing gold bars at Costco to earn cash back and reach promotional thresholds.

> Some people also participate in what are known as buying groups. Stores often tell customers that they can buy only a limited number of in-demand products, like newly released iPhones or electronics on sale. But some companies want to buy products in bulk. To circumvent the limits, the firms will work with a buying group, in which hundreds or thousands of individuals will each purchase the product separately and then resell it to the bulk buyer. That way, the buyer gets all the product it wants, and the group members harvest credit card rewards.

> Internally, financial analysts at credit card companies often project that most customers will sign up for a card and then use it for most of their purchases, Mr. Hochschild said. That way, issuers will lose money on the promotional offers but make up for it in swipe fees and interest payments over time. But that assumption can backfire, especially when offers are too attractive. Then a rush of people seeking to game the system can flood in. “Every person who just does the letter of the promotion and no more, you lose money on,” Mr. Hochschild said.
