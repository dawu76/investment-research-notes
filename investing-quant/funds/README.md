Managed Futures - [$DBMF](https://imgpfunds.com/im-dbi-managed-futures-strategy-etf/)
- This is an actively managed futures ETF that has outperformed the SG CTA Index since inception. It uses long and short positions within derivatives, mostly futures contracts, and forward contracts. These contracts span domestic equities, fixed income, currencies, and commodities. $DBMFI tries to minimize single manager risk by targeting the performance of a diversified pool of managed futures managers while charging only a 0.85% expense ratio.
- From [etftrends.com articles](https://www.etftrends.com/managed-futures-channel/andrew-beer-digs-into-dbmf-performance-ytd/): "DBMF invests across ten different core futures markets: three different equity futures contracts, three different rates futures contracts, two currency futures contracts, and two different commodity contracts. "As a philosophical matter, when we decide what we want to invest in, we believe that market depth and liquidity are really, really valuable, precious things because it allows us to go in and out of positions with virtually no trading costs," Beer explained. "It means that if the cracks underneath the market continue to spread, more liquidity flows into the stuff that we’re trading... When managed futures does the best is when the unexpected or the seemingly impossible keeps happening in markets," Beer said. "We think the diversification argument has really been cemented this year, and there’s no reason to believe that the returns that we’ve realized are going to reverse or even diminish over time just given the market that we’re in."
- But consider that "the fund started with just $65 million in AUM in January and is now closing in on nearly $700 million AUM. The fund had become a strong diversification play for portfolios this year and has offered significant returns (28.99% YTD as of 09/14/22)." Retail has a bad habit of periodically crowding into CTA funds after rare periods of strong performance.
- From the 2022-Q2 review: "First, the consensus shifts radically and often. Just a year ago, few market observers expected any inflation at all – forecasts showed a decade of perpetually low interest rates. Even by mid-August, most expected no rate hikes in 2022; today the debate is between three and four. Second, the broad macro call is only half the battle: predicting how markets respond presents its own challenges. Handed a crystal ball in December 2020 that showed 7% CPI (Consumer Price Index) a year later, who would have expected gold to decline, 10-Year Treasuries to struggle to breach 2%, and commodity-heavy emerging market stocks to underperform global equities by 25%? Third, we think this is just the beginning. That is, we are in a regime shift from a decade of soaring equity and bond prices, deflation, near zero interest rates, and endless monetary easing to something more complicated."
- "During the quarter, the Fund maintained short positions in the EUR and Yen – a bet on faster rate hikes in the US — while also pivoting from short to long gold. Additionally, the portfolio maintained its profitable long position in crude oil and rotated from international developed to large cap US equities.  During the quarter, the Fund outperformed the SG CTA Index by 290 bps."
- From the prospectus: "The fund will employ long and short positions in derivatives, primarily futures contracts and forward contracts, across the broad asset classes of equities, fixed income, currencies and commodities... Fund positions in those contracts are determined based on a proprietary, quantitative model – the Dynamic Beta Engine – that seeks to identify the main drivers of performance by approximating the current asset allocation of a selected pool of the largest commodity trading advisor hedge funds. The Dynamic Beta Engine analyzes recent (i.e., trailing 60-day) performance of CTA hedge funds in order to identify a portfolio of liquid financial instruments that closely reflects the estimated current asset allocation of the selected pool of CTA hedge funds, with the goal of simulating the performance, but not the underlying positions, of those funds. Based on this analysis, the Fund will invest in an optimized portfolio of long and short positions in domestically-traded, liquid derivative contracts. The Dynamic Beta Engine uses data sourced from (1) publicly available U.S. futures market data obtained and cross-checked through multiple common subscription pricing sources, and (2) public CTA hedge fund indexes obtained through common subscription services and cross-checked with publicly available index information. The Fund may have gross notional exposure, which is defined as the sum of the notional exposure of both long and short derivative positions across the Fund, that approximates the current asset allocation and matches the risk profile of a diversified pool of the largest CTAs."

### Global macro vs. CTA

#### References

Global macro strategy definitions
- This is a flexible strategy whose positions are based on views regarding the economic and geopolitical prospects of various countries. These views are informed by interest rates, politics, domestic and foreign poilcies, international trade, currency exchange rates, etc.
- Holdings may include long and short positions in various equity, fixed income, currency, commodities, and futures markets. The funds may take directional or relative value bets.

3 primary types of global macro funds
- discretionary global macro: in these funds, the PMs take a high-level view of global markets and allocate funds to asset classes accordingly in a flexible, discretionary manner
- CTAS: these funds rely primarily on trend-following algorithms to go long or short different assets (commodities, currencies, etc.)
- systematic global macro: these funds blend a discretionary and CTA-based approach
