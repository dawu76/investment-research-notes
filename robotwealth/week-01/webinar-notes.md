### Module 1 TLDR

Market is efficient due to competition
- so we typically end up near expected fair value
- hard to be profitable but also harder to pay far from fair value

Avoid losing $ due to the usual reasons of: overtrading, trading too big, doing "heroic things".
- e.g. if you have a directional POV, consider just buying the underlying instead of overpaying for options.
- don't take on huge trades as it's mathematically assured you'll eventually blow up
- don't try to predict the direction of very volatile assets

Goal: "get paid doing useful stuff in an uncompetitive environment" (just like in any other business)
- look for simple robust strategies, avoid trades requiring very sophisticated analyses
- strong programming skills are 'neither necessary nor sufficient' for trading success

### Questions

Question: "what happens when all RW students learn about these uncompetitive opportunities here, then go and implement them all at the same time... and some even open funds to manage $$ for other people. Don't those spaces get very competitive and disappear? How do avoid colliding with each other?"

Question: What is "liquidity"?

What is liquidity? Based on order book and the buy/sell orders there, we can buy or sell only a certain number of shares at a given point in time. If we try to offload more shares than there are open buy orders for, then we'll have to sell at lower prices.

Question: How much of the course will be focused on Crypto?

There will be crypto examples but we won't be covering specific mechanics of the crypto markets or of any asset classes. The focus will be on useful generic trading skills as well as a few concrete systematic strategies.

Question: what level of edge decay have you experienced onchain if any?

Enormous. Initially the edges were so big we could screw up and still make money but now we need to execute well to be profitable. Eventually new edges appear.
