### On trend-following performance

[AQR](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/White-Papers/Trend-Following-Why-Now-A-Macro-Perspective): "Trend-Following: Why Now? A Macro Perspective"
- "Both the macroeconomic picture and empirical evidence, however, suggest that strong performance for trend-following may persist, making it a potentially valuable source of diversifying returns during a challenging time for the rest of investors’ portfolios."
- "given the backdrop of persistently high inflation, a rapid and resolute shift in central banks’ policies, and the unexpected war in Ukraine, macroeconomic volatility is on the rise. As we would expect, this rise in macroeconomic volatility has also been accompanied by larger market moves and  improved trend-following performance. So far in 2022, market moves are significantly larger than average, and the SG Trend Index is on track for its best annual return since its inception in 2000, as shown in Figure 3. The current environment provides out-of-sample evidence that the relationship between large market moves and trend performance remains intact."
- "At their core, trend-following strategies capture the tendency of markets to gradually incorporate new information. This tendency creates persistent price trends, which may allow trend-following to be profitable on average. Notably, large market drawdowns and crises generally tend to have identifiable 
catalysts and to evolve gradually (e.g., GFC, 2022), which explains why trend-following strategies tend to perform particularly well in such environments. There is a direct relationship between macroeconomic volatility and the size of market moves, with the latter strongly (and intuitively) associated with trend￾following performance."
- "There is no tendency for trend-following strategies to perform worse than average following periods of extremely strong performance."

"This paper seeks to establish whether the strong performance of trend following is a statistical fluke of the last few decades or a more robust phenomenon that exists over a wide range of economic conditions. Using historical data from a number of sources, we construct a time series momentum strategy back to 1880 and find that the strategy was consistently profitable over the next 110 years."
- [paper](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/White-Papers/A-Half-Century-of-Macro-Momentum): A Half Century of Macro Momentum. "Macro momentum – a systematic global macro strategy that takes long positions in assets for which fundamental macroeconomic trends are improving and short positions in assets for which fundamental macroeconomic trends are deteriorating – has the potential to deliver strong positive returns with low correlation to traditional asset classes across various macroeconomic and market environments, including the potential to provide important diversification benefits in bear equity markets and rising yield environments."

### Negative Crisis Beta and the Market-Timing Ability of Trend-following CTAs

[Quantica blog](https://quantica-capital.com/en/publication/qi-2024Q2): Negative Crisis Beta and the Hidden Market Timing Ability of Trend-following CTAs
- Part of the performance of trend- following CTAs comes from an intrinsic ability to time equity market risk. We show that allowing for an unconstrained long allocation to equities is (1) key to capturing the full extent of this ability and (2) does not run counter to its risk mitigation properties.
- The contribution of negative crisis beta was positive in 15 of the 16 worst equity market quarters since 2000, accounting for more than 40% of trend-following CTA performance in these periods. Thus, the consistently positive return contribution of equity beta reported for all equity market regimes highlights a **significant equity market timing ability** of trend-following over the past 25 years.

### Macro influences on trend-following performance

[Quantica Capital](https://quantica-capital.com/en/publication/a-half-century-of-trend-following): A half-century of trendfollowing: How CTAs make money in different yield curve regimes [2020]
- Using data from almost 50 years and the resulting back-test returns of a generic medium- to long-term trend-following strategy, we have reported trend-following returns and yield attributions conditioned on four different scenarios for the level and shape of the yield curve.
- When bond futures are in a low-opportunity regime from a trend-following perspective, the trend opportunities offered by each of the three other major asset classes were at least equal to or higher than their historical average.
- Historical trend-following returns were positive on average in all four different yield curve scenarios, and only the rising rates / high carry regime has led to below average trend-following returns in the long run. When the trend-following opportunities in bond futures contracted (expanded), the opportunities offered by each of the three other asset classes expanded (contracted).
- If the current medium-term outlook for the yield curve environment suggests an increase in interest rates within a still low carry environment, our long-term results indicate that the opportunities for trend-following remain ample and healthy. In fact, our empirical results in such a scenario suggest that the expectation of below-average performance contribution from bond futures is more than offset by above-average contributions from equities, currencies and
commodities.
- If 50 years of history provide any guidance for the future, then a systematic, diversified and risk-adjusted approach to trend-following will continue to benefit from sustained trends and will offer attractive risk-adjusted returns regardless of a particular yield curve scenario.

- Volatility is great for trend following strategies. We need prices to move to have breakouts and if we’re positioned long or short, we don’t care which direction. Just get them moving and our systems will jump on board. Many of the major geopolitical fissures that cracked in 2022 and led to things like soaring energy prices have not been resolved. This means we can expect a continuation of these trends in the near future. Same goes for continued efforts to “green the economy.” This push shows no signs of slowing anytime soon, so a system that’s exposed to these sectors and underlying commodities stands to gain from continued trends.
- As rates begin to move, interest rates, which underpin the pricing of everything in the economy, experience more volatility. This volatility leads to more trends, opening trading opportunities that have been suppressed over the past decade.
- On-shoring consists of reducing the interconnectedness of global supply chains by bringing production closer to the end consumer and making markets more local. If, as many market participants predict, this leads to de-coupling of regional markets, we could see historic correlations break and have opportunities for further diversification as traders. Additionally, these moves often come hand-in-hand with protectionist policies such as tariffs and trade restrictions. This may further increase dispersion among formerly tightly connected global markets.

### CTA vs. Global Macro

Global macro strategy definitions
- This is a flexible strategy whose positions are based on views regarding the economic and geopolitical prospects of various countries. These views are informed by interest rates, politics, domestic and foreign poilcies, international trade, currency exchange rates, etc.
- Holdings may include long and short positions in various equity, fixed income, currency, commodities, and futures markets. The funds may take directional or relative value bets.

3 primary types of global macro funds
- discretionary global macro: in these funds, the PMs take a high-level view of global markets and allocate funds to asset classes accordingly in a flexible, discretionary manner
- CTAS: these funds rely primarily on trend-following algorithms to go long or short different assets (commodities, currencies, etc.)
- systematic global macro: these funds blend a discretionary and CTA-based approach

### Implementations of trend-following

[Raposa Tech](https://medium.com/raposa-technologies/beat-the-market-with-a-diversified-trend-following-model-and-the-donchian-channel-10f850ce6aee): Beat the Market with a Diversified Trend Following Model and the Donchian Channel
- Any trading system has 4 basic rules: Instrument Rule: What instruments do you trade? Entry Rule: When do you enter a trade? Exit Rule: When do you exit a trade? Position Rule: How much do you put on a trade?
- I like to use a **volatility-based position sizing** module. This scales your allocation based on the volatility of the stock, so the higher the volatility, the lower the allocation and vice versa. I usually use a 252-day lookback period (there are 252 trading days per year, so that’s a 1-year lookback) to get a reasonable sample size of the volatility.
- Specify the target risk. If we set this to 10%, it means that each position will be risk-adjusted so it takes 10% of our portfolio. Example: Say we have two stocks, A and B with a 10% Target Risk. If the volatility of stock A is 2 and the volatility of stock B is 5, then we’d allocate 5% of our capital to stock A and 2% to stock B after adjusting for risk because 10% / 2% = 5% allocation and 10% / 5% = 2% allocation.
- Entry rules: Start by keeping our entry rule quite simple and just use a Donchian Channel breakout over 100 days. This is a classic trend following indicator. I find I get better results with longer term signals (100+ days) but you could easily make it shorter term as well to suit your needs.

### On incorporating managed futures into an existing portfolio

From the Newfound Research [post](https://blog.thinknewfound.com/2023/06/is-managed-futures-value-able/), "Is Managed Futures Value-able?".

Key question: The most common portfolio tilt is towards value stocks (and, often, quality-screened value). Is stacking managed futures still attractive in the presence of an existing value tilt? A key argument for managed futures is that it can hedge against inflationary pressures. But some argue that value stocks do much of the same, acting as “low duration” stocks compared to their growth peers.

What the historical data says:
- The long-term empirical correlations between managed futures and value is near-zero, where 'value' here is calculated as the returns of long-only value strategies minus the returns of broad equities to isolate the impact of the value tilt. This isolates the returns of the active bets the tilt is actually taking.
- Correlations, however, do not tell us about the tails, so a follow-up question would be: “how have managed futures performed historically conditional upon value being in a drawdown?” The data shows that managed futures performance remained largely independent and accretive to the portfolio as a whole. In addition, univariate regression coefficients between different value implementations (e.g. FCF yield, dividend yield, earnings yield, book-to-market, and quality value) against managed futures result in insignificant coefficients.
- Conclusion: Managed futures can act as a hedge against inflationary pressures and offer diversifying exposure during relative value drawdowns.

Given an existing value tilt in our portfolio, by how much should we shift it towards managed futures?
- Calculate Information Ratios (IR) and MAR ratios for different value vs. managed futures tilts, where IR = (excess return / tracking error) while MAR ratio = (CAGR / max drawdown). Excess return = (strategy return - benchmark return), while tracking error = standard deviation of these differences.
- What the data shows: a 100% tilt to either value or managed futures is not prudent. The optimal mix, as measured by either the IR or MAR Ratio, is around the 40/60 mark, i.e. 40% to value + 60% to managed futures.
- Practical recommendations: "an investor who currently tilts their equity exposure towards value may be better off by only tilting a portion of their equity towards value and introducing a managed futures overlay onto their portfolio. For example, if an investor has a 60% stock and 40% bond portfolio and the 60% stock exposure is currently all value, they might consider moving 36% of it into passive equity exposure and introducing a 36% managed futures overlay." Question: Does this mean moving 36% of the 60% stock exposure to passive equities, 36% of the 60% to managed futures, and the remaining 28% to value?
- Given tracking error constraints, an investor can choose an allocation to the 60/40 managed futures vs. value overlay so that the overall portfolio's tracking error is within certain bounds. For this they can use the chart plotting the overlay allocation to tracking error. E.g. a 46% allocation to the 40/60 value/managed futures would result in 18% going to value and 28% to managed futures.

Given an existing factor tilt in our portfolio, by how much should we shift it towards managed futures?
- Based on the same analysis of IRs and MAR ratios for portfolios tilted towards the Profitability, Momentum, Size, and Investment factors, a 40/60 split for <factor> vs. managed futures again emerges as a robust solution, suggesting that managed futures has historically offered a unique, diversifying return to all equity factors.
- Trend-following CTAs have provided significant equity risk mitigation over the past two and a half decades. Since 2000, we estimate that **two-thirds** of the trend-following CTA industry’s total return have been generated during the **16 worst calendar quarters** for equity markets, while the remaining 81 quarters have only accounted for the remaining one third.
