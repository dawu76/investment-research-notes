[paper (2000)](https://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~keechung/Collection%20of%20Papers%20for%20courses/Behavioral%20Finance%20and%20Sources%20of%20Alpha.pdf): Behavioural Finance & The Sources of Alpha [source: [InvestmentTalk](https://investmenttalk.substack.com/p/playing-long-games-the-value-trap)]
- The paper begins by discussing the three sources of Alpha; superior information, processing ability, and behaviour.
- > "If today’s stock price is based on the market’s expectation regarding the future, then in order to predict tomorrow’s stock price change, one must have better expectations about the future than the market. In this sense, the mother of all alphas is the ability to form expectations that are better than the market’s expectations. Consequently, for an active investment manager to claim that he can generate above normal returns (a positive alpha) in the future, he must argue that, in some manner, his expectations regarding the future are better than the market’s expectations."

[paper (2014)](https://business.columbia.edu/sites/default/files-efs/pubfiles/18184/Penman_value_trap.pdf): The Value Trap: Value Buys Risky Growth [source: [InvestmentTalk](https://investmenttalk.substack.com/p/playing-long-games-the-value-trap)]
- Bargain stocks do not exist in a vacuum. They are always surrounded by high doubt and great fear. It is the inflicting pain of the relentless stock price decline in combination with temporary operational issues that creates them. Seeing "Value Traps" that do not exist is a common error among value investors. In a strange habit they call out "Value Traps" in bargain stocks with temporary, albeit often prolonged, operational and stock price weakness, unable to envision that the underlying profit potentials are often largely unimpaired

[Macro-ops post](): What I Learned From Michael Burry's Value Investor Club Write-ups [source: [InvestmentTalk](https://investmenttalk.substack.com/p/playing-long-games-the-value-trap)]
- Michael Burry shared a series of write-ups (here) between 2000 and 2002 on Value Investor’s Club (VIC). In typical Burry style, each is short and to the point, concluding with a brief synopsis of the catalyst. The folks over at MacroOps Musings wrote a great article summarising the overlapping themes of the stock pitches. The TLDR is that Burry liked absolute valuation, downside protection, small and illiquid companies, low share counts, and no restrictions for where he hunted.
