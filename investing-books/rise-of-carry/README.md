### Intro - The Nature of Carry

Carry trades make money when “nothing happens.” In other words, they are financial transactions that produce a **regular stream of income or accounting profits**, but they subject the owner to the **risk of a sudden loss** when a particular event occurs or when underlying asset values change substantially. The “carry” is the income stream or accounting profits the trader earns over the life of the transaction. In this sense carry trades are closely related to selling insurance, an activity that provides a **steady premium income** but exposes the seller to **occasional large losses**.

The classic finance carry trade takes place in the foreign exchange market, when a trader borrows in a low interest rate currency and invests the proceeds in another, higher-yielding currency. If “nothing happens”—that is, the exchange rate does not change adversely or changes by less than the interest rate differential—the trade is profitable. However, when things do happen, when exchange rates or asset prices move against the carry trader, losses can mount suddenly and substantially.

... carry has come to dominate the global business cycle, creating a pattern of long, steady, but unspectacular expansions punctuated by catastrophic crises.

We define all carry trades to share certain critical features:
- leverage
- liquidity provision
- short exposure to volatility
- a "sawtooth" return pattern of small, steady profits punctuated by occasional large losses

More on each of these features below.

#### Leverage

Carry traders either explicitly use borrowed funds or else utilize some set of contracts that creates a potential risk of loss greater than the amount of capital initially employed in the trade. This makes carry traders, and the people that lend them money, especially sensitive to losses. In an attempt to avoid losses, which can potentially be unlimited, carry traders are often forced to close positions when prices move against them... Thus, the dynamics of managing carry trade risks create fire-sale effects in which initial movements in prices are often substantially amplified.
