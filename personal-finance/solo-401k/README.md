## Solo 401k

### IRS rules on solo 401K

[IRS.gov](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/one-participant-401k-plans): Single-participant 401k plans
- A business owner who is also employed by a second company and participating in its 401(k) plan should bear in mind that his limits on elective deferrals are by person, not by plan. He must consider the limit for all elective deferrals he makes during a year.
- The business owner wears two hats in a 401(k) plan: employee and employer. Contributions can be made to the plan in both capacities. The owner can contribute both: (1) Elective deferrals up to 100% of compensation (“earned income” in the case of a self-employed individual) up to the annual contribution limit - $23,000 in 2024 ($22,500 in 2023; $20,500 in 2022; $19,500 in 2020 and 2021), or $30,000 in 2023 ($27,000 in 2022; $26,000 in 2020 and 2021) if age 50 or over; plus employer nonelective contributions up to 25% of compensation as defined by the plan, or for self-employed individuals, see discussion below.
- Contribution limits for self-employed individuals: When figuring the contribution, compensation is your “earned income,” which is defined as net earnings from self-employment after deducting both: one-half of your self-employment tax, and contributions for yourself.

### Sole proprietor EIN or plan EIN to open a new solo 401K?

[mysolo401k.net](https://www.mysolo401k.net/do-i-need-an-ein-for-my-self-employed-business-to-open-a-solo-401k/): Solo 401K - Do I need separate EIN from my business EIN
- The answer is no. This highlights one of the differences between our solo 401k plan and the discount basic solo 401(k) plans offered by the discount brokerages like Fidelity, Schwab, TD Ameritrade, etc. which generally require that a self-employed person provide an EIN for their business to set up solo 401(k). With our plan, there is no requirement to provide an EIN for the self-employed business to open our Solo 401k plan. Instead, as part of the solo 401k establishment process, we obtain an EIN specifically for the plan which meets the IRS expectation. The IRS expectation is that a separate EIN is obtained for the plan.
- Practically, this is important because to the extent that there is any type of income such as interest income reported with respect to a solo 401(k) investment, by having a separate EIN for the solo 401k plan tax reporting is done under the EIN of the Solo 401k so that the IRS understands that that income is growing on a tax-deferred basis inside your 401(k). If the interest income is earned with respect to a bank account opened under the EIN of the Solo 401k such that the 1099-INT is issued under the EIN of the Solo 401k the IRS will understand that this is growing on a tax-deferred basis and not look for the income to be reported on the business or personal tax return of the self-employed individual.

[carry.com](https://carry.com/learn/solo-401k-ein-requirement): The solo 401K EIN requirement
- A solo 401k needs its own EIN. While you don’t need an EIN to open an account, your solo 401k will need to apply for its own EIN, separate from your business.
- A solo 401k is a retirement trust, which makes it an entity that’s separate from your business. The same way that a business needs an EIN to operate, a solo 401k plan also requires its own EIN for tax filings, opening a bank account, and opening a brokerage account. Investments through your solo 401k are owned by the 401k trust, not by you or your business. When you sell an asset, the IRS is able to tell that the funds are deferred since it’s owned by your solo 401k trust.
- The only annual tax filing requirement for a solo 401k is Form 5500-EZ. Any solo 401k plan with assets over $250,000 is required to file one each year. In order to file Form 5500-EZ, you’ll need to provide an EIN. While you could open a solo 401k without an EIN, it’s better to just get one now while you’re in the process of applying so that you don’t have to worry about it later – especially given how easy it is to apply for one.
- For obtaining an EIN for your solo 401k, some plan providers will take care of it for you. If you prefer to do it yourself, the process is the same as when you applied for your business EIN. Instead of selecting a business entity, you would select “View Additional Types” in the first step. On the next page, you would select “Employer Plan (401K, Money Purchase Plan, etc.)“. When you’re done, the IRS will provide you an EIN specifically for your solo 401k trust. You can use this EIN to open separate bank and brokerage accounts under your solo 401k. If you have trouble, ask your plan provider for help.

- There is no formal requirement that an EIN be acquired for a Solo 401(k) plan since it is an owner-only plan. Many plan sponsors will use the plan participant’s social security number or business EIN as the plan tax identification number. However, any Solo 401(k) plan that wants to establish a bank account will likely need an EIN for the plan.  With IRA Financial, we can establish the plan’s bank account via Capital One without an EIN, however, if you wish to use your own bank, you will need to have IRA Financial acquire an EIN for you.
- Does the Solo 401(k) Plan Trust Need an EIN?: A 401(k) plan is a trust, and under Internal Revenue Code Section 401, plan assets must be held in trust. There is no IRS or Department of Labor requirement that a separate trust be created in connection with the establishment of the plan. As a result, a separate trust is often not established as per the plan documents. This is the reason why, in such a case, no separate trust agreement is required to be included in the plan documents, and it is also why a separate EIN is not required to be acquired for the plan trust. Typically, an EIN would only be acquired for the plan itself. Most Solo 401(k) plans will acquire an EIN for the plan for purposes of opening a bank or brokerage account.

### Using SSN and EIN for Tax filing as a sole proprietorship

[bogleheads.org](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=407992): Solo 401k -- SSN vs. EIN
- I would like to open a Solo 401k account with Schwab, but they're both requiring that I submit an EIN in order to create the account. I've heard that I can generate an EIN on the IRS website, and submit it as part of my Solo 401k application. Question: Would it be OK if my 1099 is still being sent to my SSN (and NOT the EIN), but the Solo 401k is opened with the EIN?
- Yes, that's fine. When you get the EIN online there is a place to select that it's an EIN for a qualified plan. That's what you want. The plan EIN does not need to be the same as your employer EIN (if you decide to get one at some point). You'll need an EIN for the plan so that you can file 5500-EZ someday, you can't use your SSN on that form.
- 5500 EZ requires the employer EIN, not the plan EIN.
- Question: When the time comes for me to file a 5500 EZ, what EIN would I use? I won't have an "employer" EIN and per the guidance above, I'll just have a "plan" EIN ... You need to register for a sole proprietorship EIN. It takes two minutes on the IRS site ... If I register for the sole proprietorship EIN, but continue to receive 1099's for my SSN, will that be an issue? Answer: No.
- In Post #4, MP123 was suggesting that I get an EIN for the plan and submit that to Schwab (and *not* an EIN for the sole prop). And then, if/when my 401k balance exceeds 250k and I have to file a 5500 EZ, I'll then get an EIN for the sole prop and use it for that form.
- Another comment: I don't think Schwab ever asks for a plan EIN. Only employer. Here's their adoption agreement. It asks for "Adopting Employer's Federal Tax Identification Number." I don't see anywhere to put a plan EIN. My wife has a solo 401(k) with them. I don't think she even knows or has a plan EIN ... The "Trust identification number" is the EIN for the plan in the adoption agreement you link above. But I believe you are correct that the employer EIN is used on 5500-EZ rather than the plan EIN as I first said.
- A part of me is still worried that if the 1099's are going direct to my SSN, the Sole Prop EIN isn't generating any income. Does anyone know whether that'll cause complications wrt my ability to make employee and/or employer contributions into the Solo 401k? Answers: Shouldn't matter.

[bogleheads.org](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=341358): Are there specific sections in our tax filings where I need to use EIN instead of SSN?
- When you fill out Schedule C, your name and social security number (just yours, NOT your spouse's) goes on the top of the form. Then your business name is entered in Box C and your EIN is entered in box D.
- Edit: if you happen to have separate businesses with different EINs, or if your wife had her own self employment income, each business gets their own Schedule C form. With the same personal information on the very top line and then the individual business is referenced on the rest of the form.

Does it matter for my taxes whether I open self-employment retirement account using SSN (or) EIN? Does IRS treat my SSN & EIN as same entity?
- You can't file a 5500-EZ form for the i401k using a SSN, you must use an EIN. And you'll eventually have to file a 5500-EZ when you close the plan or sooner if assets are over $250k. So you might as well use an EIN for the i401k from the beginning, even if you might be able to open it under your SSN.
- I believe you can use the business EIN for the i401k or you can get the plan it's own EIN, there's a special selection for that on the IRS EIN site.

Let's say I setup two businesses and get two different EINs.
- If we open two different Solo-401Ks each for the business. For now lets say I don't wanted to group or merge the plans. Each business has its own income generated. Can I contribute to its own respective solo-401K plans based on their respective business incomes ? Example: Business A - EIN -1 - Solo-401K - contribution based on Business A income, with a max limit of 56K (based on IRS limits). Business B - EIN -2 - Solo-401K - contribution based on Business B income, with a max limit of 56K (based on IRS limits). Now both business COMBINED I cannot put more than 56K ? (or) each business can put max of 56K to their respective solo-401k (56K+56K)?
- If you control both A and B then you can contribute $56k total. But, for example, if you work a regular job (that you don't control) with a 401k you can make a full contribution there. And then also make the employER contribution to a i401k in a business that you do control. That's because the employER contribution is an expense of the business. But you can only make one employEE deferral total no matter how many businesses (controlled or not).
- A 401k or solo 401k contribution has two parts: the employER contribution, and the employEE deferral. The employee deferral can be a max of $19.5k (plus $6k of you're over 50), no matter how many businesses, whether you own them or not. The employer contribution can be up to 25% of your wages from a business, and all the businesses that you own are one business. The total of both can't be more than $56k for one business. Each additional business can also contribute 25% of your wages as an employer contribution. So if you work at MegaCorp and max out your $56k contribution there you can also contribute 25% of your wages (up to $56k) from any side businesses you own. But all of your side businesses are treated as one.

### Other Questions

Is a solo 401k considered a separate capacity for SIPC?
- Yes, a solo 401k is considered a separate capacity for SIPC protection, meaning that if you have a regular brokerage account and a solo 401k at the same brokerage, each account would be insured up to the $500,000 limit, as long as the brokerage is a SIPC member; essentially treating them as distinct accounts with separate coverage.
- SIPC considers different types of accounts held by a single individual at the same brokerage as separate capacities, allowing each account to be insured up to the maximum limit.
- If you have multiple individual accounts at the same brokerage, they are not considered separate capacities and are combined for coverage purposes.
