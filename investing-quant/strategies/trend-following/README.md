- This post evaluates the performance of two common strategies: 1) If weak absolute performance appears, go to cash; 2) If weak trending performance appears, go to cash.
- These rules together constitute the "Downside Protection Model" based on Time-series Momentum (TMOM) and Simple Moving Averages (SMA).
- Time Series (Absolute) Momentum Rule (TMOM) Excess return = total return over the past 12 months less return of T-Bills > 0, go long risky assets. Otherwise, go long alternative assets (T-Bills)
- Simple Moving Average (Trending Performance) Rule (MA): If Current Price â€“ Moving Average (12) > 0, go long risky assets. Otherwise, go long alternative assets (T-Bills).
