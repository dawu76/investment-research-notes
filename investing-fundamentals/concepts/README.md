### Accruals

Accruals refer to the recording of revenues a company has earned but _has yet to receive payment for_, and expenses that have been incurred but the company _has yet to pay_.

Most companies have some revenues in the year that were earned (i.e., good/services were delivered) but for which payment was not received. Similarly companies oftn incur expenses (i.e., received goods/services) but don't immediately pay for them in cash. The purpose of accrual accounting is to match revenues and expenses to the time periods during which they were _recognized and incurred_, as opposed to the timing of the _actual cash flows_ related to them.

Examples
- Accrued revenues: either income or assets (including non-cash assets) that are yet to be received but where an economic transaction has effectively taken place. E.g. a company may provide services or deliver goods, but does so on credit. Accrued capital expenditures is another example: a company may have received PP&E but has yet to pay for it.
- Accrued expenses: when a company makes purchases on credit and enters liabilities in its general ledger, acknowledging its obligations to its creditors. In accounting, it is an expense incurred but not yet paid. E.g. accruals for interest expense, supplier payments, and wages/salaries.

Accrual vs. cash-based accounting
- Accrual accounting can be valuable in large and complex businesses, providing a more accurate picture of a company’s true financial position. E.g. a construction firm, which may win a long-term construction project without full cash payment until the completion of the project.
- Regardless, the cash flow statement would give a true picture of the actual cash coming in, even if the company uses the accrual method

### Valuations

From the Of Dollars and Data [blog](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/the-problem-with-valuation/): The Problem with Valuation
- On why valuations may remain elevated going forward: "I do have an issue with valuation models in general. Because, today, basically all the valuation metrics tell the same story—U.S. stocks are overvalued, therefore, we should expect a major crash as these metrics return to their long-term historical averages. Whether you use Hussman’s measure, the Buffett indicator, or Shiller’s CAPE (cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings) ratio, the logic is always the same. But, there’s a huge problem with this logic—there is nothing that says that these metrics have to return to their long-term averages. In fact, I believe the opposite. Valuation multiples are likely to stay above their historical norms for the foreseeable future. Why?"
- "With the rise of cheap diversification over the last half century, investors today are willing to accept lower future returns (i.e. higher valuations) than their predecessors. This has fundamentally changed valuation metrics and made historical comparisons less useful than they once were. Investing today is far simpler and cheaper that it was nearly a century ago. This begs a question: how much annual return would you be willing to give up in 1940 to have all the investment innovations that we have today? I bet it’s at least a few percentage points. And, if this is true across investors in general, then we would expect stock prices to be bid up accordingly over time."
- "If my hypothesis is correct, then valuation metrics should not revert back to their historical averages (at least not for more than a few months) because modern day investors would bid them back up if they did... if we assume that today’s investors are willing to accept higher valuations, then it also means that they are willing to accept lower future returns. This is something that seems quite clear in the data."
