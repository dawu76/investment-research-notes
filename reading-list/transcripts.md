### Forward Guidance

#### Emerging markets debt: 2024-08-17

"we have a treat on forward guidance today Emerging Markets are extremely important and I haven't covered them enough I am so glad to welcome to forward guidance for a fireside chat Eric fine head of active Emerging Markets debt at Vanek and portfolio of the uh vanck Emerging Markets bond fund and Natalia Gina Chief Emerging Markets Economist at vanc welcome to you both thank you hi Jack thank you I want to start with your your stories how did you get involved in Emerging Markets Eric let's start with you I was born and raised outside the US so you know that had an influence I moved to the US from Thailand um and my dad was actually a spy during World War II for the US and um uh my mother was a career Diplomat and so uh uh that's kind of how I how I grew up and um uh did my education in the states and uh my first entry into em was I worked for the US government in Russia technically I worked for Harvard uh this was during an unusual period in the early 90s when the US and Russia had incredibly aligned policies there was huge huge uh uh common interest and I built the first clearing system in the country Russia and the US had decided to do uh voucher privatization we decided to do it very quickly and 150 million vouchers were issued to everyone over 6 months old you needed a clearing and settlement system for that so 13 time zones 33 cities um it did not seem cool or interesting at the time um it was definitely none of my friends thought that was interesting but uh it was the country's first clearing system and it and uh it's the software onto which the Swift payment system was placed so you know it remains at least topical and then uh I got into research 14 years Morgan Stanley uh covering Russia Bulgaria South Africa Poland you know the EMA countries then I ran Global Research then I ran prop trading um and been at fanek for 15 years uh on the buy side um and really love it never wanted to do anything other than em at you know Morgan Stanley um it was considered a a cool thing to be offered to cover develop market economies and that would happen and I never understood why anyone would want want to cover Germany or Japan when they could cover Brazil or Russia and why are Emerging Markets more interesting to you Eric there's political risk number one so there's uh uh so you actually have to think and and um it can really really positive really negative number two it's uh it's kind of the future they're globalizing they're cheap their their productivity rates are really high uh structural reforms are proceeding so it's a it's a really a region for it's really an area for the future and growing up you know I grew up in Thailand um uh I'd wait for my school bus in the morning and I'd see the K Tha kids waiting for their it was a very very poor country in the 70s um waiting for their school bus uh in a nice pressed uniform and I saw you know I go back now and the country's a completely different place um still has a lot of problems and Thailand may be the least improved of some of the ones but um uh there's real progress right I go back to the countries I grew up in are uh every five years or 10 years or every year and they're uh invariably transformed and so that's really exciting that's really interesting about Swift I may ask you a question that later Natalia what's your background how did you get into economics how did you become an economist and then how did you specialize in in Emerging Markets well I was actually born in the Soviet Union uh which then became um several emerging markets and uh my uh kind of path to economics was uh via VI mathematics so um the economic faculty offered a very interesting combination of math um languages and fun people to meet so that's that that was the starting point for me uh then I continued my education in Oxford and when I came back when I actually started I was recruited by by bangas trust uh to work in Moscow I've got probably the best uh gift a young Economist can get I've got a major Global crisis that was the Asian crisis 1997 1998 and uh this kind of set my thinking I know that markets I knew like from the GetGo that markets can go uh up and down and and down very fast so I think that kind of formed how I how I look at developed markets and frankly my background growing up in in the Soviet Union you know when I look when I talk about reforms when I write about Argentina or when I write about India and I say that reforms should be implemented fast because otherwise the pain will be extended it's not just a um you know something uh abstract to me my family has gone through this I I have been through this I know from my personal experience the reforms work when they Fast and Furious so that's kind of that's my Emerging Markets uh background that's my economics uh path and uh why Emerging Markets it's never D moment um and I agree with Eric you know we live in the age of Emerging Markets Emerging Markets are the future so that's why I'm here and just to Echo that a lot of what Natalya writes about in her uh in her research is the structural reforms happening in these countries they do have practical measurable impacts on ordinary lives and and they're often hard to measure it's really hard to know what structural reform is so um a lot of rep Publications are about that so it's a it's a real point but you know hopefully hopefully we'll talk about India at some point today because I think that's a very interesting example of reforms working fast and actually bringing results very fast both to the people and investors so hopefully yeah don't forget talk about India today Eric I I know you know in the days when America had a a Trade Surplus and America had basically a lot of money and a lot of gold so I'm talking you know well before all of us here were born and all the listeners were born America was relied upon as to to export Capital to to the rest of the world because it had a trade surplus uh you know all of my adult life and I think a a a lot of the adult life of people listening to this America has had a deficit and yet Emerging Market countries are still Reliant upon foreign inflows and the dollar so you know your emerging Market bond fund with Van it is not an Equity Fund it is a bond fund so uh I I think a lot a high percentage of what you invest in are not corporate bonds you do invest in corporate bonds but a lot are salign bonds so you know Egypt uh Zambia India they are reliant upon you know your investors buying those bonds so just just how big is that is that world and are they Reliant upon uh in inflows and basically other people's investors money in the same way that the US is which has you know a massive massive FC deficit great question um and what you're describing is most folks image of em um and it's part partially why em has done so well is that uh the image of em was set in the 80s and 90s and it was of Highly indebted economies with unsophisticated uh shallow domestic uh Financial system and persistently High inflation and political risk and that all stopped in the late 90s you know just going back to Natalia's point we happen to share the same economic hero um Baler roitz the finance minister of Poland you know we were both polish economists back then who did you know serious shock therapy that paid dividends for 30 years right 30 years and we saw that in the late 90s with the Asia crisis you saw Indonesia Thailand Malaysia face 50% declines in dollar GDP they had to let their currencies float tolerate and and if inflation Rose they had to hike rates in a recession and if an insolvent financial institution like Finance one in Thailand materialized you let it go if Dau is insolvent you sell it to General Motors you make incredibly hard decisions and it worked and for now for 20 plus the EMS are high savings rate or low deficit countries um now the fiscal deficit and the national accounts savings investment you know is makes things a little confusing in a journalistic sense because the US has to run deficits but the bottom line is that in the late 90s almost all EMS reduced their value reduced the amount of their debt adjusted fiscal policy inaugurated structural reforms and most importantly floated their exchange rates and inaugurated independent central banks whose only job was to Target inflation so that changed in the late 90s and what happened in those last 30 years em bonds for the last 20 plus years when you can get the data um have outperformed develop Market bonds so our fund we invest in all em bonds so local currency government bonds dollar denominated government bonds and Dollar denominated corporate bonds most of what we do is Sovereign local and hard but what the EMS did through having these very high savings rates was um and it either caused it or was the result of it it was it's a lot of things um they created a domestic savings Market domestic savings system where most of their debt is now in their own currency and so you do not have these episodes of self-reinforcing crises in which the currency weakens and your ability to repay dollar debt declines so your currency weakens more big number of our countries are net creditors in dollars even Brazil which has a more questionable overall fiscal stance is up to here in dollars the specific implication or the kind of punchline of the story is for the last several years the best inside em like the Asians in particular um that I who I described I described their experience in the late 90s um have interest rates the same as the US now for for over three years running right em Asian rates about the same as the US um and uh that's a that's flight to Quality Behavior so um now you asked me about the size it's uh uh the local Market's couple trillion it depends on how you size it dollar denominated sovereigns about a half a trillion um corporates um it's about over a trillion but uh but it depends on how you slice it these are massive markets they've been around for decades they were a big thing you know in the 90s and a and for the last 10 years bonds have been such a bad story that no one wants to look inside that box called Bond BS inside it em has done well and it's for the reasons um that I reverence and also you know you know the developments that natala has talked about but I think I I wanted to add two things the importance of the floating exchange rate is this allowed imerg markets to accumulate reserves and this what basically made them net Sovereign creditors which means they have more reserves than external debt and Brazil to which Eric alluded can repay its debt tomorrow with one phone call external debt if it wants to so that's that's kind of this is a very important link um and another thing is Emerging Markets we often call Emerging Markets uh is not a monol um there are countries like you've mentioned uh which have a lot of problems Zambia and Nigeria but there are also countries which we call atantic Em graduates so this is the Czech Republic the thailands countries like that you go to tell there is no external debt it's it's impossible to sometimes Source an external warant right now in countries like that so there was this huge structural transformation which was the result of the Lessons Learned From the Past crisis and I think that's the importance of this s class and this is one of the key reasons what Eric mentioned why em bonds outperformed of the past I don't know two decades out perform developed Market bonds yeah I'm really glad Natalya mentioned that it the accumulation of reserves made them unquestionably Superior credits in dollars you couldn't ignore it and the denominated spreads on these countries over the last 30 years have been even better performing than the calculation I gave you earlier if you include local um where you can only get data for the last 20 or so years um but that was a huge positive and what it meant is or or what it reflected is strong domestic markets and if you keep them strong enough long enough legitimately main Mainely you maintain your credibility you get things not just like the last three years but like the last 5 days with markets falling apart because of this so-called Yen carry trade and Malaysian ring it the central bank had been keeping rates arguably too high for too long just waiting for the fed and if the see-through is fed is going to cut myr is up 5% in five days um as as it was a flight to Quality asset so that's a really the most interesting thing for me in the last few days is here I am you know I'm so conditioned when markets are uncertain for em to be just thrown into the garbage and it really hasn't been happening for the last 20 years and it hasn't happened yet again em exhibited really impressive characteristics in this uh whatever you want to call this this Yen wash out trade the free floating exchange rate is you know people are sometimes upset about weakening IM currencies I think for me this is one of the most important shock absorbers in mge markets which allows us to stay invested in the asset class because when the currency weakens central banks can hike interest rates there is self- adjustment happening especially the external balance reserves are accumulating and you know even countries where we have issues with local de like Brazil external debt outperformed uh this year by wide margin why because you know Brazil has got a lot of problems but external is not one of them so this is which is why you know both Eric and I we can keep keep back going back to these reforms we don't you know there it's not just an empty word it's basically something that formed our asset class let it develop let evolved and allows us to stay invested in this asset class regardless of what happens in global markets regard regardless of global turbulence that's I think that's the key lesson for me and so we we're recording the morning of Wednesday August 7th uh it was Monday August 5th where the Japanese stock market was down 12% as the Yen finally strengthened after its incredible depreciation over the past uh year year and two years and that was as the bank of Japan and H needless to say the bank of Japan Japan is a developed Market a DM it is not an em emerging market so Eric I gather that you think a lot of weakness is coming from developed markets Sovereign Bond markets not Emerging Markets uh Sovereign markets which might be the perception of of many investors who their playbook is is 1997 where Emerging Markets really had an issue yeah think it really is pretty remarkable um if I were you know writing Glo if I were responsible for writing the global narrative the my title for the Japan episode would be another developed Market blows up Financial confidence another right this you know the global financial crisis was a run on the US Financial system derivatives You could argue right a lot of causes but that was that then you had two Euro Zone crises and then now you have the country that first experimented with money policy um that uh that is overbed that's coming towards the end of this you know exit Strat or trying to exit and arrived at hiking interest rates into a recession into a Slowdown right so that that I think is the most important takeaway and the other important takeaway is who cared the only things that cared in EM were brl and MXN where there was arguably some sort of carry trade and in Mexico that was kind of of a heavy position anyway um but you know what no one you know what was anchoring everything you know why no one really cared about JPY CNY CNY was an it's China was an anchor of stability the FX just sat there that's why myr could rally that's why Thailand could rally is that's the only way this thing transmits and now Yen maybe could correlate with Korea but you know Korea also had you know is in a different stage monetary policy-wise so yeah I think this is a yet another develop over indebted um DM economy with great political sort of uncertainty creating problems um and by the way paying you nothing while it's happening right that you know that's the main reason to you know best prediction for a bond return is what your carry is um and the carry in EM is still so much higher than it is in DM and that's our real point we don't need to have an an adverse scenario for DM because you're getting paid so much in real or you know in dollar comparison terms in in em oh but you know in all fairness since you've got an economist uh in this podcast there actually there there are more than uh channels than just um kind of car trade volatility uh through which currencies like the Japanese Yan can affect iming markets perhaps the car trade unwind volatility being the most visible and loud but it seems to me the competitiveness Channel potentially is the most important and long lasting right so uh so you talked about the uh the car trade you know um um and uh which you know created kind of another B of volatility today but the second way the Japanese Yan can affect image markets is by a portfolio rebalancing so specifically repatriations by Japanese investors if the Yen strength continues which it might because you know the BJ is still expected to out tighten the fed by about 100 basis points over the next 12 months and there is an argument that this risk balancing will be felt more in developed markets rather than emerging with which I agree but if you look specifically at em bonds which is the topic of today's conversation countries like you know China Singapore South Korea Malaysia Mexico were particularly popular with Japanese investors so we might see some potential outflows there and the third perhaps as I said the most important for the real economy channel is competitiveness so countries like Japan China South Korea but and also Europe have kind of a high degree of overlap in export products and until recently the Yen weakness created a lot of competitiveness issues for China which had to balance its Reliance on exports to prop up growth with the need to maintain currency stability and domestic financial markets stability so if the Japanese Yen strength has further to run Maybe not today but like in the next six months and importantly in it persists this can actually reduce pressure on other central banks in the region to weaken the respective currencies for competitiveness purposes so I think it gives them more policy space so which is why you know people like me look at what happens with the Y not just you know from the point of view of day-to-day Market volatility but I think it can affect the real economy as well so the the carry trade is f folks investors borrowing in Yen at very low interest rates previously negative interest rates now all you very very minor positive interest rates 0.25% and investing it in anything that yields higher which is everything European bonds are yield higher American bonds yield higher and Emerging Market currency so you said that the sum the car trade of favor in some instances is borrowing in Yen going into Mexico MXN the peso borrowing in Yen and going into the Brazilian real BR brl and so that could explain some of the weakness but and natal you're also saying that there's a there are additional channels not just not just carry trade so just be mindful of wider imp impact on both the um kind of em um assets especially em bonds and certain currencies but also the implications for you know China's growth model for example for China's uh policy space because China is trying to experiment and slightely kind of change not slightly but to change its monary policy framework so I think what what happens in Japan is actually much more important than just volatility trades or car trades yeah and as the Yen weakens it it becomes more attractive to the the rest of the world and and more attractive to buy Japanese Goods uh like if you could buy I'm more competitive correct yes un a fashion brand from from Tokyo um you know I'm sure they produce it all around the world but if they produce it just in Japan they would be paying all their input cost in Yen and selling it in which or other currencies which are much stronger and that makes that competitive and it tell you a lot of folks are saying the reason that the stock market the Nick the Japanese stock market sold off so aggressively on Monday was because as the Yen gets stronger it becomes less competitive for Japanese markets so do you think that there's a dynamic where as the currency weakens the stock market in local currency terms uh become stronger because it can out compete the rest of the world look I mean we've seen something similar in Turkey uh but we are not investors in local currencies we are US dollar based investors so we cannot ignore the exchange rate you know we uh and Eric perhaps can elaborate uh on this a little bit more but we do not really hedge our exposure because you know if if you're thinking about hedging maybe you need to rethink your exposure in that market generally speaking but I think that unfortunately the currency d mention is very important for us we cannot just ignore it but you right you know there are there are instances when uh you know stock market R in local currency but which meant nothing for for US dollar based investors or and maybe maybe Jack I'll just uh break it up a bit which is Yen stronger hurts the carry trade right so this and and and Yen weaker um helps the right reinforces it um uh whatever economic impacts there are longer term term um are longer term right and so the Market's very much focused on is it up or is it down is it hurting the trade or not and what are the asset prices that are showing themselves to be vulnerable um uh so that's you know one point to make the other point to make is and that's why I framed it as yet another DM crisis is nothing is working that's the real story in general rates are higher in Japan and the FX is weaker it happens to have reversed recently but that's a nowhere no place to hide Market especially when equities which were one of the places to hide because that's also a carry trade um uh uh was part of it so I think that's the bigger picture that this kind of volatility coming from a DM is not a good sign right and if you're a central bank and you're dealing with your interest rates higher and your currency weaker you're in a box you're in a corner and what happened during all of this is that even when em currencies just there was really only two MXN and BR were weakening because of this unwind their interest rates were rallying it was purely technical we had underweights in these by as it turns out and we and we viewed it as buying opportunities that helped maybe helped us have that attitude was that maybe it should have sold off and then the last Point um to make is um Chinese inflation is lower than US inflation and yet every Wall Street Journal article compares the nominal yields between these two countries as if it's some big challenge well if you look at the real yields the the Chinese currency has been cheapening in real effective exchange rate terms for years now so it's rock solid getting cheaper it's waiting for the FED to cut but doesn't need to and who did the work to push the FED to cut for them Japan that's the story that's the story Japan had the pain Japan had to use its had to generate the sort of energy to get to get this see-through to to rate cuts and it helps every single em in the world because they've all been sitting around pressured by these nominal rate comparisons with the US and they're like what can we do everyone's talking about this nominal rate differential okay fine we'll maintain real rates insanely for even longer period of time like we have for decades and now the coast is clear arguably I hope that was a kind of clear tie-up can I can I actually bring you back to uh because something that you said uh made me think about the second uh major developed Market forced to walk back their policies you know the UK about year and a half ago and now Japan like literally within days of of tightening of policy announcements I thought this is I mean I cannot possibly imagine uh correct me if I'm wrong this happening uh in am um you know it's just it's absolutely fascinating so the speed I mean in terms of you know Global uh Global issues we are talking about like literally milliseconds uh have to you know the bank of Japan have this doish policy remorse this morning like days after an unexpected surprising rate hike this is this is a complete reversal this is completely unexplicable I mean that's not a stable policy environment and and again underes credibility for sure it undermines credibility for sure and it doesn't look like the UK was an exception um some time ago it it's becoming a rule really and look at what and look at what the Brazilian Central Bank did in its minutes earlier this week got hawkish that's just they have one Focus inflation these you know they have similar inflation rates to the US and you know 10% Market rates and uh double digit policy rates but you but you know why the Central Bank of Brazil Eric could become hawkish because of those reforms because these banks in central banks as a result of the structur reforms are de facto independent they do their job they target inflation and as a result they can hike or be as h as as they want right there was this very interesting discussion and it's not just Brazil you know uh that was very interesting discussion between the governor of uh you know Bank of Thailand and um and and the government about who's responsible for reforms and it's not you know the central bank's job to fix certain things so I think that's what really makes imj markets very different from the developed counterparts everybody knows em central banks know the job they know they're independent and they know they how to do it Brazil uh they raised interest rates as inflation roed its head in 2022 to 13.75% which is very very high meanwhile the bank of Japan raises interest rates from 0.1% to 0.25% and the entire Global Financial system loses its fine yeah can you say leverage that's what that is that's what that is one one Central Bank is incredibly levered or One Financial system is incredibly levered if you want to look at that that's why we always start with debt levels you know either total economy or Central Bank right there are different ways of of measuring of measuring those but I was glad yeah Natalia made that point on on Japan credibility and on Brazil the the political political politics are driving a lot of things right now it's unusual for politics to be driving the US right you know other than Healthcare versus defense stocks sorts of uh uh thinking but given concerns on inflation uh I think it's worth noting that the EMS that went through their crises and laam a lot of them the 80s and 90s Asia you know the 90s um very different political configuration exists in these em countries you're it's very hard to get regardless of where you are on in our political Spectrum doesn't match the rest of the worlds of course but it's it's hard to to to to generate support for policies that say they're going to harness a central bank to achieve economic outcomes um because it it's blown up right and it and it kills the poor inflation kills the poor kills governments kills Financial systems and they went through it so a lot of these a lot of these Orthodox policies are are popular not rah rah popular but yeah I get it we can't do that kind of popular and Eric a lot of these a lot of these Orthodox policies are across the political Spectrum which I think brings I think Mexico is a very interesting example because when uh president amlo was elected I remember going to to meetings and everybody was telling me this is the end of the world so we elected a populist and Mexico was having I think what 2% deficit during the co it was probably too Frugal to stent now bring the latest elections and the whole conversation is all over again so Mexico is losing its uh fiscal uh anchor it's the end of the world Claud sh Bal is elected let's run and what GL sh bom is doing literally within hours been confirmed as President elect she reconfirms uh Minister of Finance who is an orthodox guy who in turn uh sets up a conference call with investors reassuring them about what about the continuation of fiscal adjustment yes there will have extra fiscal spending in the election years should be expected but this fiscal Orthodoxy uh this message was out like immediately you know you didn't have to wait until uh the the new budget will be out in the fall that message was out within an hour and this is you know this comes from the party which is not usually associated with a lack of populism so you know this is um you know even in Brazil Lula has to negotiate on certain issues he cannot just have whatever he wants on fiscal in the fiscal sphere so um yeah these markets learned uh and and governments learned the lessons and frankly it's the markets and the population and rating agencies which help to discipline them which unfortunately doesn't happen in in the case of development to of when it comes to Performance of Emerging Market bond funds you can either invest in local currency so non-dollar damin bonds so the Malaysian ring gets or you can buy the Malaysian Sovereign bond in dollars and that is what's called hard currency so when often it is true that uh Emerging Market currencies H have underperformed the dollar and ultimate example that the the Turkish L but that is is really only half the picture because those currencies yield far more uh so for example one thing that I I really don't like is when people say uh you know oh in 1910 the value of a dollar was X so therefore if you had a dollar in 1910 it's now worth the purchasing power one penny and that's true if you just kept it in a vault but if you yielded it in in cash and you got you know uh 4% when the interest rates were 4% and then in 1980 you got 177% or 19% you actually kept up with it and in the case of Emerging Markets the idea is that the additional carry uh Brazil the Brazilian currency will yield more than the dollar yes I don't I don't think that's really the story I think the story is that if your currency is weakening but something else happens to support external debt Sovereign bonds hot currency debt like you mentioned turkey so when the Turkish L was selling off and local Bonds were underperforming big time for the first half uh after the elections uh uh after latest presidential elections H currency Sovereign bonds staged a massive rally why because floating currency means less wastage of international reserves and this what you know we we we did this trade I mean we we really enjoyed being in Turkish uh H currency bonds at that moment in time so that's exactly the I mean that's the the key message floating currencies and structural reforms allow you to stay invested in the asset class even if the currency goes to hell you can still make a lot of money in in many instances in in in Sovereign worlds and frankly weaker currencies in sometimes uh in in certain cases can um can support uh local corporate bonds local corporates because you know uh especially if they um uh have some export Revenue so Eric maybe you can elaborate a little bit more on that but I think that's that's really I mean this story has got three components to me it's not just about carry and underperforming on weak em currencies it's the fact that the currency underperformance paves the way for often outperformance of corporate hot currency bonds and Sovereign hot currency bonds and we said heart currency bonds you mean the dollar so if dollar denominated or has been weak and it has been quite weak the dollar denominated bonds do well because the currency weakness is a shock absorber that's it's a shock absorber exactly and it it and it leads to automatic adjustments of external balances it reduces Imports it allows it it boosts uh exports and if the central bank is not trying to artificially intervene and support the currency it also means High International reserves which again is supportive of uh uh H currency or US dollar denominated debt right thank you for that Natalia what I was just saying is I wanted to explain to people like oh the Brazilian real has depreciated against the dollar why would I ever invest in a Brazilian you know because you yield more that's what you know what I'm saying I would say the following um uh first just very narrowly um when you see pressure on a local currency you know what you often see from locals they buy their dollar denominated bonds they don't exit right so that's one point is you can stay in EM they're winners um but uh um I think the main point on the local versus hard issue is em is not a monolith and it depends depends very much on the country and where it is and what's cheap and what's not so that's one point and the other point to put it together for for your listeners if you've got a low amount of debt it's a good thing because you have less dependence on financial markets um you often are paying as much as you're borrowing right or often you know for example Thailand is often paying more in principal and interest then it's borrowing from the market so you create these great technicals from from a low debt level and good fiscal policy but the most important thing you get from that is your central bank can have independent monetary policy it can it can easily Focus only on inflation and it can always maintain High re rates which they've done um and so the low debt allows the central banks to pay you more it doesn't mean that they're always doing it and it doesn't mean that it's enough but that central bank rate is the anchor for their yield curve and it's often ends up with Market rates double or triple what you see in the US and it means that the currency has to sell off if you're going to lose money because you know all things equal you get your carry you should expect some currency weakness if the yield is high that's what it's there to compensate for and I think that was your point Jack is that the FX can weaken but you can still make money and what was so fascinating with this the the Japan you know carry crisis was what i' mentioned earlier which was it was only the fects us that were weakening the bond prices were going up M Bono prices were going up their yields were going down so this was not an exit this was a very technical thing having to do with FX probably a lot of forwards and derivatives but not an M Bono holder right those rates went down why because the seethrough from the episode was lower rates and if this was a confidence crisis in some of these countries their rates would have pushed higher uh and they didn't so um so the duration component Emerging Market bonds actually rallied in local currency terms because they said whoo the bank of Japan the last Central Bank to have negative rates they actually don't have any teeth whatsoever so Emerging Market central banks can cut interest rates for example uh the Brazilian Central Bank and so they rallied as interest rates fell because everyone anticipated that the the the odds of the FED cutting were much much higher the confidence of the forecasts the confidence of expectations right now are very very different than what they were a week ago you had first you had the CPI report January 11th I think sorry July 11th I think it was um uh then you had a uh uh un you know last week's employment report and um uh and that paved the way and then you had this you know this this this uh crisis and the see-through was okay not only have we had economic weakness and and the door opened from from inflation the door to cuts open from inflation but oh my gosh Japan a major you know a very important country for for for the US um needs C needs rate cuts from the Fed um and so if that's the strong opinion why you know Mexican rates are highly correlated with us rates um and they rallied whereas if this was an exit oh my gosh this is a recession or this is a crisis then you would just exit mbonus and that did not happen so we're pretty strongly minded the the uh and like I said also we didn't own it you know we we thought the big problem with Mexico was that it was just too heavy and we didn't own it into the election and then it you know cheapened out um and we see Mexico's the problem with Mexico was never the heterodox see that was never Our concern the problem with Mexico was too many people owned it and JPY knocked it out um and made it cheap and attractive and that's all we wanted and when you say too many people own it h how much of th those in investors are unlevered funds such as yourself versus leverage hedge funds versus Banks yeah hedge funds aren't that big in this space and the big hedge fund trade on the themes that we talk about about of of some countries in good shape and some countries in uh bad shape fiscally in the big picture sense you know debt and and fiscal and monetary policy the big issues had expressed it mostly intra G10 intra G10 so uh with emphasis on the funding side right in other words it was such a Negative view on Japan that what you were positive on was not the most important thing you're making money because you're well the relative rates were right you're paying this on your on your funding and you're receiving this and the currency is weakening so you're making money every day and you don't need let's say British pound guilts to be rallying so that was the bulk of the TR I think where bulk of the action was it is hard to gauge so what we do is we look at the screen and we look at what how is the market reacting and it seemed very short live and and and not a big issue I think the issue with the emono trade was similar to why em is kind of em bonds have been ignored for the last years which is um a lot of investors uh uh get the EM idea right they've got low debt they pay you more for it it's done better than DM for 20 years what's the problem and they'll mention problems and so uh uh and one of the problems is they have to go to some committee that says well isn't em a disaster always and you know isn't it always generating these crises and uh and um and so that's sort of a little bit of a headache people don't want have to do that and uh so uh there was a big desire to put the trade on but not not doing it conventionally and I think it was arguably somewhat lazy trade from crossover um and a lot of big institutions is yeah I get em I'm going to express it all in Mex peso all in M Bonos um and that's the complete opposite of our philosophy we think you're supposed to be incredibly Diversified um there's Alpha all over em you don't need to be that concentrated but um um it was much more an em long only phenomena and I think that's why the market reacted that way they didn't change their mind on on Mexico was just an fx FX moved all over the place the rates rallied people didn't sell bonds so uh yeah I don't think the hedge funds have been really a big deal in our space um if any it's you know MXN BR that kind of stuff but um they're not a really big presence the Brazilian hedge funds can Al also be uh sometimes move things a lot but they've been they've had a lot of sort of burned fingers so I don't I don't I don't think they're doing much and you own a lot of different countries including Zambia Chile tell us about the the role of diversification and you know if invester would ask you why Zambia okay Eric we understand you want to invest in some countries where they have a risk but Zambia that's a little out on the risk curve I mean what are they paying 40% I mean you know what explain explain that yeah so uh first on your point on diversification um our funds incredibly Diversified I love looking at our pie chart um and investors I think like it because they you know they see the you know the carry of seven and the yield tour of you know eight and a half or whatever it is um and then they see the pie chart and they see things all over the place so I I diversification is important and i' mentioned before that it's not a monolith you that that there are um asset prices that behave as riskof you know Safe Haven type asset prices some that have beta so diversification is really important and I'd say the most important thing you get in EM is you diversify out a DM you diversify out of DM right in other words it's it's great that you have divers diversification inside em um in principle um but uh uh it's it's it's the big concentrations are in DM Bond markets that's where everyone just sits and is relaxed the framing quote for our fiscal dominance piece was the Mark Twain quote it ain't what you don't know that's going to get you Brazil is not going to blow up the world right it's it's what you know for sure that ain't soow right that's what's going to get now um and so with that let's turn to Zambia around 30% rates um and uh entering an IMS program right and they just settled with external Bond holders and uh they floated the exchange rates somewhat um and uh uh and are paying really high real rates and sideways pays us a lot now we got sideways on rates and the FX rallied the last couple quarters um um but the most important point I mentioned I'd make is these are small positions you mentioned Zambia it's neat it's cool you know but I guess the point would be that you know when something's yielding 30% you really kind of have to have a lot of damage you have to predict a lot of damage and um now of course it was cheap on our process and in our second step of our process we said IMF deal debt deal all good stuff positive so we didn't see any of these non nonsystematic reasons uh to cancel it but we will be nimble on those things that's the other key thing is you know one of our lines is we do not do Friday meetings right we don't we don't think all week and then say well what are the trades we'll do and we'll do them on Monday we're we're up you know at night and we'll do things quickly we have exit levels for everything um uh most of the time we're not doing stuff but on these smaller names you know they can be volatile um uh but yeah the there are a if you invest in all em bonds you you're you're basically seeking in a much bigger Alpha space there's Alpha there but we have a very small exposure it's it's a not a not a Big Slice of the of the portfol our our con we are you know constrained we can only deviate from The Benchmark so much anyway so um yeah we like Zambia we do like Zambia and and subsaharan Africa has a lot of really po I mean this is this is Natalia's exciting area I mean some of these countries are really doing at the bottom is people are voting for the person who's going to keep the electricity running n not based on other more uh uh uh it used to be much more along either tribal or religious lines but there's a real sort of growing Urban class that you know that's very Cosmopolitan we see that in Nigeria um with Peter Obi um um but you see that in a lot of these countries there have been a lot of uh uh changed governments that have gone through really anti-corruption processes um and you know you could put Zambia maybe Angola in those categories and it's not just anti-corruption it's also kind of the use of modern Technologies like digitization I mean this stuff really helps in terms of Revenue collection and very low tax collection is really this country is a killis hill we're talking about like 7% of GDP Revenue collection 10% of GDP so you know when you hear that 50 60 70% of of Revenue goes uh on to to interest to to service the debt I mean this is the reason why because Revenue collections non-existent I mean so for these guys to pay attention to what happens in countries like India which made Extreme I mean absolutely massive improvements uh by using digitization by making it widespread I think technology really helps and I think that's what perhaps um I think a lot of investors maybe underestimate this you go to the IMF and digitization is a key word in pretty much each and every uh developing country meeting um that's that's a big deal that's really is a big deal I I don't want to give the impression that is it all Z IIA fund the uh percentage in the Zambian currency Zambian quanta is is 2.2% and by comparison you've got 5.7% in the South African Rand and 7.4% in South African bonds uh hard and local currency and that is as of June 30th so it might be slightly different now Eric also you know I point out maybe there are ad advantages and if you if you ever have Alpha if you ever have a reason why investment out performs there there ought to be a reason and some uh times the reason is it's misunderstood and so I'll give you an example is if a if an oil company went bankrupt in 2016 and they emerge from bankruptcy and people you know people say oh it's it's bankrupt they're they're bad then it'll be cheaper and you could buy by taking advantage of the fact that people don't understand the Currency Change maybe what it is is Zambia is sounds a little bit like Zimbabwe which is you know the most inflationary currency ever and you can Harvest that premium of people not understanding that it's a different country or or I think you are totally right crazily you are completely right you know it's funny when I speak to us investor audiences um even institutional you know sometimes um uh you don't mention country names in the US you mention any country name in the US and people freak out um I think it's misplaced but but um uh Europe is more is much different Asia is a lot different in terms of receiving that but yeah you mention a country name they'll think political instability um backward Financial system uh poor structure bad debt everything you know and it's I don't think that's I don't think that's correct and it's creating an incredible it's creating an incredible opportunity uh in you know Brazil has you know what 4% inflation probably mov into three handle um um that's not that bad and look what they're paying you it also oh I was also going to mention that um since we were talking about subsaharan Africa but also just how em has changed is the role of China not just as not just CNY being stable and their policy generally being respected but um uh China's acted fairly constructively in subsaharan Africa in the last year right it's lot less of an obstacle in this so-called um new architecture right where China's a big bilateral lender and it was kind of viewed as um not being quick enough in agreeing along with IMF and Paris Club res structurings um but uh that that's gone away all right that they there are now models they're now cooperating with that and it's an alternative source of Lending for these countries so it's a real real positive right they they don't just have to go to the US or the international financial institutions China's there as well and and not in a way that's encouraging these countries from to uh to exit um reform programs in other words they don't want to lend to into a default situation just as much as the IMF doesn't um uh so it's just it's arguably purely just an additional source of financing to a lot of these countries but talking about subsaharan Africa um I think one of the perhaps most misunderstood stories of the past year was South Africa's fiscal adjustment uh in the runup to the elections which was completely unheard of and frankly this this this is the fiscal sleeper Story of the Year um absolutely incredible so you know it's not just small countries with strange names that perhaps some investors um you know Mis misunderstand or or mishar or misread it's big countries like South Africa uh uh in the region which uh you know uh do incredible things uh run incredible adjustments and it's pretty much ignored by the Press until you know some people started to scream about it on every corner so yes it's h it's not just Zambia it's h I think South Africa was a great fiscal example by the way this year a really truly truly unusual story when the fiscal performance improved in the election year that's on the spending side which was absolutely incredible and what was that change to Talia and I should say per June 30th for the public disclosure for for Eric's fun that South Africa was as I mentioned earlier the largest waiting uh in his fund 7.4% including South African Rand and and dollar Bond so what changed is uh you know the the RO elections where uh surprisingly South uh the the African National Congress didn't perform as well and South Africa ended up having the first ever government of national Unity which is kind of a strange animal nobody knew exactly how it's going to how it's going to work but it looks like it's it's a big government but it's a for all intents and purposes it's a Centrist government U with good appointments in key Ministries so the expectation is that it's got a fairly stronger form mandate uh there was an uncertainty for about a month I would say after the elections which was unfortunately Amplified by some uh without naming names unfortunate reporting in the Press which was I think very negative uh but I think it's it's a great story which has got further to run in the next several years uh if this government implements reforms continuous uh fiscal adjustment continuous reforming state-owned Enterprises it's it's a prog gross setup and it's a pro fiscal adjustment setup which benefits local bonds first and foremost and natal you tell we and I can tell you've been wanting to talk about India tell us about what's been going on in India and I should say the stock market in India has been on fire but I noticed that I'm not seeing any a ton of Indian exposure um in ER fund and so then I can ER can explain why perhaps the the importance of India is that it basically shows that structural reforms can bring results in in a short period of time in three to five years rather than three decades and both the population and investors can benefit from these reforms and three areas where India's structural progress was was especially impressive are first of all taxes second digitization about which I was already talking and formalization of the economy and these reforms help to unleash this massive growth potential and as a result India is one of the best em girl stories right now and it could be a defensive play amidst the US recession fears your uncertainty about another round of trade war with China Rising geopolitical tensions especially in the Middle East and looking forward if current trends continue in 12 15 years India's economy will be of the same size as the Euro Zone becoming effectively another independent Global growth driver and from the fixed income perspective and that's what kind of what uh what um limited our exposure there before um India was not included was not part of the EM local Bond index so this inclusion happened about months uh yeah slightly more than a month ago and uh with a very small initial weight but But ultimately India's weight will grow to 10% so this is kind of the event of the year which we close watch very closely and this inclusion resulted in huge Capital inflows which also hopefully will further structural reforms especially fiscal adjustment because you know that's what fixed income investors are watching and India's dead to GDP ratio unfortunately kind of highish by imerg market standards and the first signals are very encouraging you know the 2025 budget showed that Mod's government is not turn populist despite worse than expected performance um in the latest elections and also you know I hope that India's local board inclusion will help to boost Bank landing and improve Capital allocation because with a new buyer out there for government bonds Indian Banks can hold fewer government securities and explore other investment and Landing opportunities you know Investments is not India's strongest point right now so if we indeed see more progress in this area it could be very growth POS positive and with that I'll I'll pass to Eric to talk about our exposure in India yeah you know India is a bit unusual um and if you asked if you were talking to me let's say in the late 90s um I might you know um I might have had a different uh attitude but in the late 90s a couple of countries um Malaysia um India You could argue China um um has arrived at this well that's what I'm going to argue Indonesia to an extent of um uh of a stable FX policy essentially you could call it investment Le um but an investment L policy but essentially keep the FX stable to create uh a a stable investing and and inflation environment right that's the idea now if they can intervene that's sustainable if they can keep inflation under control that's actually sustainable um and if they can keep fiscal and financial under control that's actually sustainable now the reason I would in the late 90s when would have said this is Malaysia tried this and and um uh and all the cool kids said that was wrong and you know I was still younger and wanted to be a cool kid and uh but um a lot of those Pol there doesn't have to be one we're more comfortable naturally with an inflation targeting regime and a floating FX India doesn't have it China doesn't have it either um and uh and sometimes it works but it doesn't work to generate really high carry and good Bond returns to the extent it works it can create a great economy and great Equity returns right the story in in in China has been equities not Bonds um certainly not their local bonds we've done interesting things there so in corporate bonds um and so that's the answer on the biggest chunk of India and our Benchmark their local government bonds is um that's not how India is being managed it's not being managed for the good of that market it's not a bad Market um but it's just not cheap enough uh for us and and it maybe stays that way which is fine um what we're doing there is we have uh uh corporate Bonds in dollars and they're generally project bonds right where the the the um proceeds from most of these are energy generation uh go directly to the you know go to are owned by the bond holders they're not at a holding cly level so we own operating company level bonds and they're cheap because and we do a standard analysis there right we just compare the fundamentals these corporates to all the corporates in our database and they're paying us way too much um and and we see nothing in India on our second step of our process for non-systematic risk all the stuff is good and I'd remind only because we're talking about India um but remember what the story was at the beginning of the year oh my gosh there all these elections and these crazy insane dysfunctional EMS what a disaster it's going to be and what did we get India continuity basically Mexico continuity South Africa the most reformist government arguably in a long time with an alliance with the da um so and what have we seen in the developed markets right I you know political risk has to be pronounced in in in the US and and parts of uh and in parts of Europe so uh um I wanted to mention that especially in the spirit of your earlier question Jack about the sort of image that em has and even after South Africa had this you know alliance with the da the headline wasc gets below 50% for first which was never the Market's expectation African National con Congress yeah thec yeah the headline was they got below 50% for first time you know that was the headline that we saw and you know we were you know we were getting ready for this thing for weeks and we were you know everyone was looking between 39 or 41 for these guys but because uh this is kind of an asset class order there's just not a lot of people looking at it it was oh I haven't looked at South Africa in years oh what happened oh thec was below this well no one that was always going to happen um and what was not focused on was the likelihood of an alliance with the reformist or it was definitely Market friendly da which is you know what materialized but also the tone of the reporting is kind of it's it's it's almost anecdotal but I was like literally running to Eric in the morning uh while all these things were develop Eric somebody is G lighting me because the I reading in the Press is not what I'm seeing it's like literally 180 degrees I mean that was the coverage was kind of very unusual um that's why can be great that's why that's to to Jack's point that was great for us but I was just yeah it was uh the recollection of uh of those morning complaints for for a couple of weeks yes that was I told I told tell you I'm glad they're misreporting it right there was I don't know how that's my problem right that's as long as you know what you're supposed to do and what's what's actually happening and so it's an important point that uh Count's policies can be good for the equity Market but less good for the bond market so you say Indians I'm just looking the the bank of India's policy rate is 6.5% that's not good enough on The Sovereign level to to really get you that excited Eric uh now let's turn to China where their interest rates are are even lower what are your investments in China and how have you positioned there there and why yeah China's been very interesting um we're not interested in onshore bonds and uh they're not attractive on our process even given the statements I made about their real rates being higher and and being the the more correct way to look at it but they're not attractive on our process and given heightened political and geopolitical risks these are custody onshore right in onshore meaning not our Shores not Western Shores and so um you can't ignore that risk and if if I'd want to get paid a lot for it and I don't think you can get paid a lot for it so if we ever were attracted we'd do it through an offshore vehicle like Asian Investment Bank uh uh that issues Bonds in CNY with a similar yield to the government curve but um they're offshore uh so uh but in general not cheat cheap and it's got that layer of R now um uh China uh we had been for years mining our own business not really investing much in in Chinese corporate bonds because they were just weren't that attractive um and uh they blew up right the corporate bomb Market blew up so IG Bonds were you know trading at cents on the dollar and so for the past now two years we've found really attractive opportunities there very idiosyncratic and uh there were kind of three categories one was uh multinationals with offshore assets that um we're not too worried about like a fosun or something like that um and uh another category was actually owned by the government let's say Ministry of Finance owned hon right and some of these bonds just because everyone was selling went to 60 cents on the dollar right for for something maturing in a couple years that's that's that's and the entity owned by the Ministry of Finance and whatever China's problems are dollars is not their problem they have you know their dollar denic government debt is is is Tiny um um and then there is this other category of the truly risky stuff that you'll read about and maybe in the Wall Street Journal um and those were trading at low prices and so we got attracted to those but because you know corporates can liquid and because uh China headlines can you know hit something that maybe it shouldn't hit just because of liquidity um we've always had a shorter flashlight on it so we didn't think we'd own these through the rest of the year we have reduced some of them that hit targets um because we were are worried about geopolitics it's not a headline over the weekend from a legislator in the US you know can can can affect any liquid Bond if it's dramatic enough and it seems as if we're in a world where you're supposed to be wary of that so we have a you know we have our finger on the trigger there generally and we've reduced recently and might do more might do more the great thing about China is everybody hated it um as well and we didn't talk about investability but that's a big question that comes up a lot like is it even are you know big institutions are saying well should we just X China from benchmarks um and that's that's a real thing I think that's a reasonable thing uh uh to worry about we got paid a lot for it this year yeah it's the economy which is in the middle of a major structural transformation so you cannot I mean it's when such a big structural shift happens when there is a change big change attempted change in in China's growth model it's difficult to have um you know long-term um secular kind of exposure to China but it's it's not impossible to write these policy waves because you know they are attempting certain things but I think there is certain kind of misunderstanding when you ask a question about IND stability it seems to me that the Market still somehow expects this you know a wall of liquidity to appear in China kind of something similar was so popular in the west during the past crisis and it's you know it's not going to work in China it's not going to happen because you know many policies that China is trying to implement is basically the longer term structural issues and as I said I mean staying invested in the country which is in the middle of structural transformation I mean China knows that it's got a problem but it will take a lot of time to fix it and China is not looking for for fast uh fixes uh like for example the housing sector it might take a little bit I would say uh maybe too long to find some you know developing a blueprint for defaulted real estate companies but nevertheless China's problems are is on liquidity there are very deep structural problems which will take time to resolve so and don't expect a wall of liquidity which is why I think that's what I think at the the core of this question about investability in China a few years from now if China is successful in developing its social safety net uh res resolving some of the housing issues maybe maybe using Central government's balance sheet uh because you know the central government's data as Eric pointed out is still very low in China that that could be a different story but that's that's a long-term drive this is a long-term Drive in China but you can still write like policy waves to make money and then tell you C don't don't expect a wave of liquidity uh and of liquidity yes wall wall of liquidity what are is the structural change in the Chinese economy that is coming from the top and what was the old Chinese growth model what is the new Chinese growth model and how far along is China you know are they 20% of the way there or 55% of the way there or or closer what what do you say yes so the old growth model was based on several things first of all uh exports uh real estate and a lot of lending so if you look at China's overall indebtedness it's probably closer to Japan than to Poland I would say so you know the leverage the issue of Leverage in China is a big concern and there was some B total economy total economy total economy it's not the central government total economy and there were you know the real estate bubble so China knows that it has these problems and it's trying to resolve them which is you know unfortunately happening in countries like Germany uh you know you you you wake up an average person and ask them something about Germany's growth models they probably wouldn't have a clue but you know China's growth model in food display and what is happening is effectively addressing the excessive leverage issue and also trying to kind of deal with the real estate bubble without collapsing the sector so uh what there are some interesting um ideas there like for example social housing buying some of the housing stocks from private developers by the government agents and uh you know uh developing them into affordable houses which I think is great in terms of something like similar to maybe Singapore model that was mentioned as well so these are very uh these are great ideas but you cannot resolve uh these issues in one year or maybe even in three years or five years it's a long-term process right um and and these are structural process which there's an interesting example so uh some of the uh some of the vehicles financing vehicles that was set by the government especially in real estate in China they're not fully used like some of these facilities are you know the average outtake is about 20% why because there is no demand why there is no demand because the isues are structural so you can throw as much money as you want at these issues and the result will be the same another problem is because the old model was so kind of glued so linked with the with leverage with real estate um Chinese consumer is uh the only thing Chinese consumer wants to do right now is save there is a very interesting um uh survey done by The People's Bank of China uh which shows the consumer willingness to to save to consume to invest in real estate in new houses and to invest in in in the stock market and the only line that goes up is willingness to save so giving more helicopter money in this situation what is going to resolve this money probably will not going to be spent on consumption but will go to savings so I think the general direction is absolutely right um but and again China is trying to do certain things there was some interesting statements from uh from the Central Bank advisor senior advisers maybe doing something about implementing inflation targeting so you know there are interesting ideas but I think China is still in the searching stage which is why I'm saying I don't know whether it's 15% to 20 you know it's it's difficult to quantify but um the the the model is becoming different it's becoming more inward looking as regards the type of the growth model um and frankly we cannot always expect China to save the world's growth uh but you know the rest of the world especially merging markets can still benefit from China's evolving growth model because you know most likely it will remain commodity intensive yeah I would just I would just say two things to to add or sort of reinforce that trck uh first is um China like a lot of our countries don't have policy makers that wake up in the morning and think about how to get the stock market up right and ju look at what Japan and the US did right US Stocks now 5% and the FEDS predicted you know is priced at doing an emergency cut what kind of policy-making environment is that that your entire policy-making apparatus gets activated by declines in equities that's not very serious right and and uh and and so it's a good thing that China's not doing this big bang this big rescue like they did after the GFC for the planet right for planet Earth that's one thing and the second thing I'd say is terms of the EMS I really the transmission mechanism is CNY and it's been stable and getting cheaper right so it's protecting consumption baskets for for for Chinese and is still attractive so you it's a good thing when a country has low inflation an ongoing structural reform agenda and another thing is I would really yeah would really encourage our listeners not to think about China as a as a single entity as a monolist there are different Chinas there is a old economy versus the new economy which by the way is doing quite well the rural China versus Urban China coastal areas versus hland North versus South different policiy agendas different policy priorities so it's a it's a very it's a it's a complicated story because China is a complicated economy so so that that model the old model of very export driven manufacturing driven uh but uh not very high in the value chain and then accumulating a large amount of us treasuries and foreign exchange reserves and then having the banking system be quite levered and lending to infrastructure and real estate and have the real estate developers be levered you know in the America the subprime mortgage bubble that led to the great financial crisis that was home buyers being levered in this case the the Chinese household is not quite levered and actually they have a very high percentage of savings of their their income the The Leverage was in the developers of of real estate and that bubble if we can call it uh you know began to implode in 2021 I'm just looking at collection of of property bonds and that really collapsed in value uh you know down to 30 cents on the dollar by which is great which is awesome yeah that's the market that's the Market operating for you yeah why not what's wrong with that why should a government prevent prices from being discovered this is a great thing when a government doesn't step in and protect the whole sector may not be good if you owned the bonds but that's you know we didn't and and we looked at it as a track but I sorry to interrupt but I wanted to make that point is that these governments don't wake up every morning and try to chin up markets right that is just not how they view their jobs yes and I think people can think America capitalists China communist and in some ways that frame of reference makes sense but it is not the case that uh the Chinese government likes to print a lot of money and give it to Citizens and bail out citizens or even corporations um if they do that they they do it through the banking Channel rather than through the government Channel where in America you know we have become quite fond of that over the past 20 years well but you know what let let me tell you one thing I think there is an understanding you know if you look look at the uh at the uh share of consumption in the US GDP it is much higher than in China so if you think about kind of vehicles to stimulate growth the emphasis maybe on consumption in the years makes sense as well as the emphasis on manufacturing infrastructure in China makes sense because the share of these two in in GDP is much higher so it's kind of in a sense if you try to look at the vehicles how to provide it kind of near-term fix to grow that's a very natural response to me but what I see right now is that in the situation where a lot of reasons behind you know why the con Chinese consumers step step back and not participating kind of not consuming as activ before these are structural issues so you throw the money what will be the result what will be the Improvement the money will go to savings I I would you know pretty much sure 100% of this money will go into savings oh yeah but one thing's for sure is look China owns the banks and it owns the S soes um and so a crisis out you know is not an obvious thing and so these these structural changes that natala is talking about um will you know have have a a an arguable context of extreme stability as we've seen in CNY and also by owning assets um that does put a government in position to to to give them to populations right in in formal form you know in in in uh um as uh essentially assets for for social welfare programs um kind of a you know retirement Healthcare whatever you however you want to think about it um but that's you know something that that uh uh could materialize there as well but the main I think the main point is whatever they're doing it's been it's uh it's not crisis generating um in fact it's stability generating and that's what we really care about and the rest of China is individual trades that either make sense or don't but crisis isn't what they're generating and part of the reason why is they're not trying to Jin up markets every morning they're willing to let prices settle where they need to settle and Natalia earlier you said that financing vehicles I believe your referen to uh local government financing vehicles lgfvs in some instances hadn't used all of the money that they do explain that because from my you know skimming the articles about China uh compared to your you know detailed analysis and you know a lot of things that aren't even in the entire articles Lo local government financing vehicles in some instances are having trouble because there's not enough money so can you what I was referring to what I was referring to is um support programs there were certain support facilities set up by authorities basically to provide support uh to to to struggling economic agents including uh to summon real estate and what I found very surprising is that on average if you look at all these support programs out there I think if I'm not mistaken uh a few months ago they were used um I think only 80% of of this uh money were used because there is no demand and the percentage the usage the actual usage of these support funds in real estate was close to TW 20% so which basically tells me it's not necessarily the issue of money it's the issue of making regulation changes structural transitions uh maybe you know a huge issue in in real estate is unfinished houses so I've mentioned houses that were finished but unsold unfinished houses is a huge issue people paid money but they are yet to get the houses do you expect these people to consume no way absolutely zero chance these people are not going to consume and unless and until this problem gets resolved D but you know when you look at the actual support programs out there the fact that they are not fully used is an indication that it's an issue is on the demand side it's not the supply it's not it's not the supply side issue it's a demand side issue in this particular case which has got to be resolved structurally not might not by using another you know helicopter money or wall of liquidity how you call it yeah it might not the model is not going to be the sort of Western model where just tons of things get thrown um and you worry about the consequences later they're just not the most of our countries don't make policy that way they can't they you know they risk they don't just risk losing right they Lisk a lot more than losing their political power right um uh one thing you do we didn't talk about in China but I'll only mention this to you jack in case you have a followup on it but um one thing that's changed is the treasury accumulation policy you mentioned seems to have changed please mention that that's of extreme interest to our viewers please yeah they've obviously had a gold accumulation strategy know we look at you know central banks for for decades and one of the strongest opinions I have is I believe a lot of the data um it's often secret and big important countries Russia was a country I grew up with there are almost always deals with local Miners and Russia and China have huge mining Industries um where you buy at a price that you don't know or that's agreed to sell directly to the central bank and you don't want to report a lot of this stuff right these Sovereign wealth funds and advanced countries don't like reporing their Holdings either so I I get that but but um uh gold is has uh has definitely increased in most DM central bank balance sheets not so much DM so that's interesting and uh the if you put yourself in the seat of a central bank what do you want your bonds want High re rates set by an independent Central Bank uh uh in a reasonable fiscal maybe Financial context um and you certainly don't want to think that they could be seized right so you kind of won them over at the higher real rates and good fiscal policy um uh but when you add sanctions risk that becomes existential right bra Brazilian authorities can't spend a moment worrying that if they change policy that that that that their National savings it's accumulation of the the Citizens Savings in a way it's their National Bank um um gets you know dissolved or or seized so or or canceled in the same way that Russian uh Holdings of us treasuries were kind of canceled right yeah that's exactly what I'm referring to right that's a that's a big moment um and it's a big moment especially for China because who could be on the other side of that um and what's interesting about this development is we've been talking about central banks buying em bonds for 15 years now I worked for you know Larry summers in Russia a long long time ago he was talking about this in 1994 That central banks should own em bonds and it was debated whether treasury should buy M bonus in was kind obscure little piece of History um uh but uh you know what central banks don't need to take orders from a famous economist right um and uh luckily um in the last couple years the IMF has been producing a lot of reports kind of backing up this idea um and it's you know I don't think the headline you know dollar loses its Reserve stat that's not happening right but um uh headline more and more em countries that deserve it have become Reserve assets that's that's happening so the IMF um specifically noted Singh and uh was was it sing in Korea natala I don't think they mentioned all it but these are are Reser reserve and the last thing I'll say is when you see these headlines saying the United Arab Emirates agrees with India to to to sell oil for for INR what do you think the UA Central Bank is doing with the INR right they're not just sitting on it now to go from a trading currency to reserve currency a lot of steps and you know not it's not a headline kind of thing um but the INR is piling up right and it's natural for central banks to start investing that in in the bonds the bonds if they did it with us right why why wouldn't they and um uh and that's a really important thing DMS are are globalizing and finding new financing sources and they don't really need them I mean everybody needs them um and uh and I don't think uh Western authorities understand I don't think Western authorities are even um set up to think that they need to do work to borrow money no definitely the US is not that you have to answer questions that you have to engage with people and uh um whereas all of our country you know all of the countries we invest in and you know they think they having debt management offices who have serious policies to address our question and they value our questions right they want to hear what they're doing so that they don't do it um so it's a very very different it's a trickier attitude dealing with policy makers that that you know aren't worried about things like that kind another another thing I would like to add here kind of very quickly it's not I think the whole debate is often framed in terms of oh China is selling US dollars or somebody's selling US dollars I think you know it's it's much simpler Emerging Markets accumulated plenty of reserves many of them I mean some like Zambia we still have to do a lot of accumulation but kind of advanced Emerging Markets em gr is the people don't need more reserves why because it's expensive to manage them you know Brazil was actually talking about maybe selling some of the reserves a few years back because it's it's expensive they have enough so if you don't have that marginal buyer who will step in who will be that new marginal buyer if emergy markets are not accumulating more reserves part of which you know goes into into US dollar denominated assets so I think this is really this is kind of a big uh it's not kind of this huge headline you know China is selling selling treasuries but that's what is happening and this is a huge process and frankly this process has got further to run but it's not going to end up this year on the next one that's the future and Natalia you said that Emerging Market countries you in general they have plenty of reserves so they run a trade surplus and they use the money that they have to pile it into us treasuries or european uh you know EUR denominated Sovereign bonds or gold but uh isn't it the case that if they continue to run trade surpluses they're going to have to put that money somewhere right so you're saying that they're they're going to hold the marginal FX Reserve is going to be less dollar denominated perhaps less Euro denominated and maybe they're going to hold it in their own currency or other Emerging Market bonds yeah it's not the trade balance I would say it's more kind of uh it's a current account uh how this money are re recycled effectively but you know there is an argument if we have a different type of globalization if it's more kind of regionalization rather than globalization perhaps some of the surpluses can become smaller and I think that's this is a good argument for this and again I mean uh you you you you sit down and you think what you buy uh if you look at gold purchases by Emerging Market central banks after the global financial crisis they skyrocketed you know you put uh two charts uh two lines on the same chart one is the Polish Central Bank buying gold and other one is Chinese uh Central Bank buying gold they will look pretty much the same so Emerging Markets are buying gold so there is a diversification of those surpluses that they need to recycle with perhaps small going to Gold we seeing these gold purchases I said China is probably kind of newsworthy uh country but this is happening not just in China countries like you know Brazil uh turkey uh Poland that I already mentioned Poland increase like added a lot to its gold reserves in the past in the past year so it's diversification of reserves and also think about the size of those surpluses it's not the type of curent count surpluses we've seen in their early 2000s they are smaller they are back the surpluses are back which is great for external for external bonds for you know the dollar donated bonds but they are much smaller so it's an issue of the size and also the issue of how you invest them in what particular asset you put the money which does not necessarily have to be the US dollar assets and so the the old Narrative of dollarization is the US dollar uh is going to be dethroned as a reserve asset by the Euro or perhaps the Chinese Yuan that has not really happened really at all but you're saying there's a different transition of instead of the dollar being uh 70% and the Euro being a much much smaller smaller percentage and the Euro replacing the dollar the dollar is going to just go down marginally but the Malaysian ring is going to go from 0.01% to 0.2% or and that is going to have a big impact doesn't sound like a lot but it will have a big impact on you know Malaysia will not be the only country whose reserves uh whose assets will be accumulated effectively by this by the central banks and gold as I said don't forget about gold you know there are other interesting assets around I don't want necessarily to to name them here which might become Reserve assets so there is definitely the dollar has got competition it doesn't have to be dethroned it's not about dethroning it's about you know the dollar will have to doll assets will have to work harder to be interesting and to be attractive for em central banks or let's say uh Sovereign wealth funds for example and this you know raises a question about the yields on US dollar dominated assets do they have to be low or maybe they have to be higher to be competitive and to be attractive right so dollarization is happening slowly and gradually there's not going to be a headline all right I don't think there's going to be a headline um but it's an ongoing process um and uh and one thing I wanted to say is you know a country can generate more dollars in than out of the country through the trade Channel or through the capital account channel right and a lot of these countries are attractive destinations for Capital um and and uh um and on the question of what are they going to have as assets um they're going to have other em bonds and their own and their own right that's the ultimate goal right is to is is to have your own countries bonds um as as your reserve asset it takes a lot of time to generate that but that's that's what's happening that's what's happening You could argue that's what's happening in China and do you think that the result of that will be a lower value of the US dollar against other currencies or a higher interest rate needed on the US Treasury to keep the dollar constant I don't know what Eric thinks I'm kind of I'm was thinking about high interest rates used toll assets yeah I think it's I think it's kind of a entering a heterodox World basically um uh it's I do I don't think it necessarily leads to a negative dollar view because most debt is in dollars and risk off um involves buying dollars and so that is going to take a long long time uh uh to unwind um I think um uh uh I think the you I think the issue is that if it becomes difficult to finance um uh what is the natural policy reaction for a highly indebted country that has shown that it wakes up every morning trying to Jin up stock markets I keep saying that but I think that's more or less where we are um and that's why I started with Japan as the first story your rates go higher and your currency goes weaker I think that's not a bad idea to have in the back of your mind um however uh the US is by far the least dirty shirt um Yen and Euro go down before the dollar if this is even a story and I'm not saying that it is um and um and uh uh and what happens is especially when you have these big fisal requirements is the interest rate should go up and it's not allowed to so I think we're ending looking at essentially control regimes in the west uh uh yield curve control for example right we're looking at uh um uh the market doesn't want to lend you at that rate okay well change the rate right um and uh uh and and if that and that won't need lead us naturally to outward pressure on the dollar as it would in other countries because of this riskof Dynamic that most debt is in dollar so people are buying it um uh I'll say two last things if the Dollar's down 20% no one cares in America no one's even going to know right um but after that it might the other thing I'd say is and this is consistent with this being a real process is um most people think the dollar was up I don't know what period of time like let's say last year right it's not true if gold goes from 1900 to 2,300 Dollar's down right so we're just looking at a whole bunch of other otheres going down relative to Gold um and that's you know to the extent that gold is becoming much more of the reserve asset and so I think that's something that's very very poorly understood um uh but um central banks the bottom line is if central banks are buying increasing number BS you're in good shape because you me you have an alternative source of financing and uh and if the opposite is happening that's tougher for you um now we're so big that if rates go up ycc may be the answer as it was in Japan um and that creates all sorts of other problems which I think the conclusion of is exactly what we said be very wary on DM that none of this needs to be happen none of this needs to happen for DM bonds to still be unattractive just getting not really getting a very high rate um and and um and so uh you know that's also something you know we remind is is you haven't had a crisis in in really you could argue in the US and the bonds have still performed poorly relative to DM bonds but these are big issues but I think they'll be managed I think the plumbing will be managed and that could make it a lot worse could make it a lot worse um but it attenuates it like all these things they buy time and it depends what you do with your time right if you're implementing structural form like maybe is happening in China or and definitely a lot of our countries that's great um but if you're just buying time with no policy and that's where I think the the the political and policy uncertainty in the US is is pretty important so Eric you think there there will be a time where the tremendous volume of debt that sovereign debt that that developed markets have produced will result in much lower Bond prices and higher yields on those bonds you know in other words the Reckoning that uh has appeared to to you know be be uh Justified that has so far not happened you think it will happen I think uh I think it will happen but I think it will be gradual and I don't think it's going to materialize in a crisis manner um if you're not allowed to express it in higher yields or uh um then it'll pop up in different things and that different thing is classically inflation but you know Eric one thing is um just wanted to draw your attention listeners attention to some very interesting Studies by the IMF which suggest that the neutral rate in developed markets including the US is likely to increase in the coming years which is not necessarily the case for emerging markets so I think it's not that explosive increase in yields we are talking about but some of the underlying drivers in developed markets might result in a high interest rates High neutral rate um in the coming years and here's how it plays out out very practically for your listeners Jack because we've SE we see this every year and you know we've been doing this for decades government gets on TV inflation inflation is is is two your real wages went up and you say that a few times and then a few years later turns out inflation was five or four um and that's you know I'm not saying that that's any government maybe they should do that right but that that that that's that's what happens but that is how you attenuate these things um and they become not I don't think the decline of I think uh declining use of treasuries is a real thing and increasing use of em bonds is a real thing on Central Bank assets but um I don't think it's a a useful guide to practical day-to-day investment decisions but you can't ignore it either you can't ignore it either because you got to know in some countries it can be a big deal that that's a really good point that you know day-to-day things are not going to trade based on dollarization but but it is happening on the margin uh slowly Eric tell us about fiscal dominance and is it true that high interest rates can be inflationary if the stock of debt is so large tell us about this theory that you've had for for quite some time that back in the day a lot of uh developed Market people did not take seriously but now some are yeah it's you know it's still it's still a heterodox view but it's but um I don't think it's as heterodox as it's presented so first fiscal dominance is something that is you know part of formal economics teaching um although phds aren't required to take history anymore but Natalya luckily took a lot of it um so fiscal dominance is is when your debt is so high that monetary policy doesn't have traction doesn't mean anything and the extreme result of this which we've seen in a bunch of countries is that because fiscal policy is dominating fiscal policy is driving all asset prices that when a central bank hikes rates the only calculation is oh debts going to be that much harder right that much higher and you're only worsening the problem by hiking rates now that is basically a heterodox argument because because it's not going to help doesn't mean you shouldn't do it anyway um or just because it's not going to help doesn't mean you're not supposed to learn and do even better things different things maybe use your fiscal toolkit or your structural tool kit um um but uh uh the problem is when debt is too high Central Bank cannot be independent that's the main point they cannot be independent they can't have a singular focus on inflation because at a certain interest rate you're bankrupting your government that's the problem and the EMS were in this situation in the 80s and 90s and had a whole set set of different problems and now they're largely out of it most their debts local and they have independent central banks so um so fiscal dominance is a real thing the EMS were on the bad side of it and they now are completely on the good side of it and you see this for their Decades of surviving these DM generated crises and the EM the DMS are on the bad side of it like I mentioned heavily indebted governments that you could argue have co-opted their central banks to achieve economic outcomes or financial stability outcomes or government financing stability outcomes right a central bank buying government bonds you know that didn't you know up until the 50s that was not the tool right it was corporate Bonds were the were the tool um good central banks make speeches to their fiscal authorities and say stop or hiking rates which again I sort of describe the policymaking framework here as we're here to Jin up markets every day and talk about um um you know some of these Orthodox pillars but really not do anything about it right look at the political landscape in the US right where we're supposed to where we're supposed to have differences between the parties this is my description of us politics and policy for the last 30 years Republicans wanted low taxes they got it Democrats wanted High spending they got it and I'm supposed to blame one and not the other right it's it's and the result is high debts and high fiscal deficits High debts and deficits which are so high that the central bank is arguably losing its independence and credibility that is a big turn off to other central banks right in other words you can go to your populations and say inflation's three you know 2% when and then exp poost a few years later turns out to be four um but other central banks are not you know not going to be as uh uh sort of convinced by that because they you know they live in countries where that Trick's been done right and the US has a advantage of when there is a growth scare when there is a re recession scare such as the type that we had five days ago on on Friday early August that that benefits US Treasury bonds because there's a bid for safety and many countries particular many par many Emerging Market countries don't have that and when they go into recession interest rates go up but you're saying Emerging Market countries are used to that and you actually are seeing some big dis safety like quality such as in the Malaysian ring and other currencies I would also say that you know Barry iing green a great Economist who wrote a paper about living with high debt for the 2023 Jackson Hole of course we got the 2024 Jackson Hole Federal Reserve uh uh Symposium coming up shortly about how advanced economies DM de developed markets had very high debt loads and that had increased although Emerging Markets have delevered uh over the past 20 years and we could show those those charts up and you know I'm gonna I'm going to take Barry ien Green's a word for it and so that is very Central to to uh that theme um as we approach a close you both have been very very generous with your time we I want to do picks and pans so which countries you like or overweight and which you would underweight and why so let's let's uh start with Natalia what what countries do you pick and with jpan okay uh Germany is my pan because I think it's a great example over a growth model gone wrong and really struggling to adjust to rapidly and very radically changing circumstances if you look at kind of uh what Germany's girls model benefited uh in the past I don't know couple of decades at least three of these factors like energy trade and defense are no longer there and you know you've got the rising populace sentiment in a country which is driven by economic energy uncertainty insecurity uh that are concerns about immigration policies overregulation is a major issue you know a related problem is industrial policy which is driven you know there is this absolutely fascinating uh IMF study it's not driven by competitiveness like only onethird of all industrial policy ma measures in advanced economies were driven by competitiveness they were driven by other things like climate mitigation supply chain resilience uh security consideration so you know that that's this issues facing German economy are massive but I it seems to me that structural reforms aiming to restore Germany's competitiveness is is an afterthought at best and this is just such a huge contrast with such emerging economies like India I was just talking to you about this you know we call India at one we call it an Rising M Star not just because you know a fantastic performance of its stock market uh but because of this structural adjust that unleash the growth potential and frankly I'm not um maybe less negative than many people on China for the reasons I've just described because China knows that it's got a problem and it's trying to find a solution which I think is a great start thank you uh Eric your picks and pans yeah well since uh natala I think rightly pan Germany I'll just start with Europe and I'll pick Poland and Hungary um for the center of gravity in Europe has moved to Poland um and the external accounts of Poland are very much benefiting from a lot of this support um and also seeing a pretty serious energy transformation so they're the real winners both from uh investment and also from uh in Poland's case from sort of remit remilitarization um uh uh efforts Hungary also benefits because it's not really spending that much and doesn't have to right that's kind of The Quirk of of of uh of what they're doing so um would put those as winners uh and I I wanted to Jose it because of what Natalya said dmem right Germany's the loser pole and Hungary the winner Right double the rates much better situations um um and my and Natalia's economic hero comes from Poland um uh and so you know their policy is incredibly anchored um I'd also say a word for Mexico and Brazil especially right now um we had been cautious and we think this this yen Kur fuffle um has created a nice a nice opportunity there were a few bad things that happened into this and we didn't have you know significant exposure there and uh it really eliminated a lot of our concerns um in in U Brazil and Mexico local last thing I'd say is we continue to like duration continue to like duration the big thing um a few weeks ago was uh uh fiveyear yields coming below tens um I think the next which is a big Power powerful roll down argument um for institutions it's kind of like the retail argument of well look your t- bill rate's 5% but you don't know if you're going to get that in a month and uh um and so if the next thing is that the two-year comes below the fiveyear that's just a a transformation and the attitude towards bonds I think when people look in that box called bonds the thing that's going to be the shiniest is going to be em um and that you know that you know that's another view of mine uh but uh yeah i' those are oh and pans Egypt over indebted everybody loves it um they've gotten so much money and it looks like good news but it is conditional money even the gulf money is conditional and we don't see any real transformations in the Egyptian economy the ownership um and by the way you know I I'm not gonna I'll just use the term politics right I mean it's that's got to be that's an obvious additional layer of risk uh very interesting well this has been been a a fascinating chat um Natalia your work is is great and you are very uh great about sharing it on Twitter your Twitter handle is Nuru um and you are are criminally underf followed and I I think that is because you know unlike me or other people on Twitter you don't do engagement farming you only post value and and right now I'm posting I'm looking at who follows you and it is uh very serious institutional investors and and Heavy Hitters some of who have been on this program so uh for you know emerging market economics stuff uh people really got to follow you and Eric you of course the vanac Twitter handle is is vancare us um you don't have Twitter but you are on LinkedIn and and the name of your fund is the vanc Emerging Market uh uh fund with the I think there are three different classes emx EMV uh EMV uh YX and um yeah Eric just say say a final thing about the the the Emerging Market Bond Fund why em bonds over DM bonds and then why your bond fund over passive em index uh y em over DM em has lower debt pays you more and it's a winner in the current political and geopolitical environment why us over others is uh we don't wake up in the morning and salute The Benchmark and we don't do Friday meetings if things change we change quickly we're very F focused also our first step is we want cheap things we want cheap things um and uh um and then we use some common sense you know tests for non-systematic risk."
