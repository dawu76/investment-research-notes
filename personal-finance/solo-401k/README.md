## Solo 401k and EINs

###

Comments by E*Trade retirement specialist [2024-12-20]
- Deadlines for tax year contributions (e.g. 2024): Employee contributions should be made by 2025-01-10 - slightly after end of calendar year to account for payroll; empmoyer contributions can be made up until 2025-April tax filing deadline.
- How to specify whether contributions are for employee or employer: by default, contributions to E-trade's 401k accounts will be on behalf of employer. In order to classify contributions as being from employees, call the E*Trade retirement team before end of calendar year to request that certain contributions be reclassified; this can be done in bulk to retroactively reclassify past contributions.
- Employee contributions are subject to a total limit of ~$23K across your IRA and 401k accounts. Employer contributions may have a higher limit up to 25% of your business income.
- E-Trade Solo 401(k) message on funds transfer page: _"E*TRADE will show Individual 401(k) contributions as employer contributions and Individual Roth 401(k) contributions as employee contributions in the transaction history. You must track employee vs employer contributions and report based on your own records."_

- Without an EIN your business bank accounts are a reflection on your credit instead of your company.
- Note: A DUNS number, or Data Universal Numbering System number, is a unique nine-digit identifier for businesses.

### IRS info on single-member LLC

[irs.gov](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/get-an-employer-identification-number): Get an EIN
- When to get an EIN: If you are forming a legal entity (LLC, partnership, corporation or tax exempt organization), form your entity through your state before you apply for an EIN. If you don’t form your entity with your state first, your EIN application may be delayed.
- Definition: A sole proprietorship is a business that has only one owner and is not incorporated or registered with the state as a limited liability company (LLC). A sole proprietor can be a self-employed individual or an independent contractor. Sole proprietors (self-employed individuals) report all business income and expenses on their individual tax returns (Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, Schedule C, E, or F). A sole proprietor may or may not have employees. What it is: A sole proprietorship is a business owned by one individual. A sole proprietor can be a self-employed individual or an independent contractor. All business income and expenses are reported on the individual's federal income tax return. A sole proprietor may or may not have employees. What it is not: The business cannot be incorporated or registered with the state as a limited liability company (LLC).
- Definition: An employer plan is a permanent arrangement under which an employer provides benefits for employees. Employer plans include: 401K, money purchase plans, SIMPLE, SEP, ESOP, retirement plans, profit sharing plans, defined benefit plans, etc. If you already have an EIN for your business, you can use that EIN or you can apply for a separate EIN. Please consult with your retirement plan professional to determine whether you need a new EIN for your plan.

[irs.gov](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/single-member-limited-liability-companies): Single member limited liability companies
- If a single-member LLC does not elect to be treated as a corporation, the LLC is a "disregarded entity," and the LLC's activities should be reflected on its owner's federal tax return.
- If the owner is an individual, the activities of the LLC will generally be reflected on: Form 1040 or 1040-SR Schedule C, Profit or Loss from Business (Sole Proprietorship); Form 1040 or 1040-SR Schedule E, Supplemental Income or Loss; Form 1040 or 1040-SR Schedule F, Profit or Loss from Farming
- An individual owner of a single-member LLC that operates a trade or business is subject to the tax on net earnings from self employment in the same manner as a sole proprietorship.
- For federal income tax purposes, a single-member LLC classified as a disregarded entity generally must use the owner's social security number (SSN) or employer identification number (EIN) for all information returns and reporting related to income tax. For example, if a disregarded entity LLC that is owned by an individual is required to provide a Form W-9, _'Request for Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and Certification'_, the W-9 should provide the owner’s SSN or EIN, not the LLC’s EIN.

Background [[TurboTax](https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/self-employment-taxes/what-is-the-purpose-of-an-irs-w-9-form/L0ZtUOnSk)]: What is the W-9 form?
- The person or business paying you is responsible for requesting the W-9 Form from you. However, the requester has no obligation to file the W-9 with the IRS. That person keeps the form on file and uses this information to prepare other returns, such as 1099 Forms and 1098 Forms, as well as to determine whether federal tax withholding is necessary on the payments you receive.
- You will usually submit a W-9 form when you engage with a company where reporting information to the IRS might be necessary, such as receiving payments for services you provide as an independent contractor, paying interest on your mortgage or even contributing money to your IRA account. The individual or business you are doing business with uses the W-9 to collect some of your personal information, the most important of which is your taxpayer identification number (TIN).
- For certain _Employment Tax and Excise Tax_ requirements discussed below, the EIN of the LLC must be used. An LLC will need an EIN if it has any employees or if it will be required to file any of the excise tax forms listed below. Most new single-member LLCs classified as disregarded entities will need to obtain an EIN.
- A single-member LLC that is a disregarded entity that does not have employees and does not have an excise tax liability does not need an EIN. It should use the **name and TIN of the single member owner for federal tax purposes**. However, if a single-member LLC, whose taxable income and loss will be reported by the single member owner needs an EIN to open a bank account or if state tax law requires the single-member LLC to have a federal EIN, then the LLC can apply for and obtain an EIN.

### IRS rules on solo 401K

[IRS.gov](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/one-participant-401k-plans): Single-participant 401k plans
- A business owner who is also employed by a second company and participating in its 401(k) plan should bear in mind that his limits on elective deferrals are by person, not by plan. He must consider the limit for all elective deferrals he makes during a year.
- The business owner wears two hats in a 401(k) plan: employee and employer. Contributions can be made to the plan in both capacities. The owner can contribute both: (1) Elective deferrals up to 100% of compensation (“earned income” in the case of a self-employed individual) up to the annual contribution limit - $23,000 in 2024 ($22,500 in 2023; $20,500 in 2022; $19,500 in 2020 and 2021), or $30,000 in 2023 ($27,000 in 2022; $26,000 in 2020 and 2021) if age 50 or over; plus employer nonelective contributions up to 25% of compensation as defined by the plan, or for self-employed individuals, see discussion below.
- Contribution limits for self-employed individuals: When figuring the contribution, compensation is your “earned income,” which is defined as net earnings from self-employment after deducting both: one-half of your self-employment tax, and contributions for yourself.

### Do I Need An EIN To Open A Solo 401k?

[Carry.com](https://carry.com/learn/solo-401k-ein-requirement): Do I Need An EIN To Open A Solo 401k?
- Technically, you could open a solo 401k without an EIN if you operate your business using your Social Security Number.
- A solo 401k will need to set up its own EIN in order to set up bank accounts and brokerage accounts under the trust.
- Getting an EIN is free and can be done online in just a few minutes. Usually, the IRS will issue them instantly.
- If your business is incorporated, it’s likely you’ve already registered an EIN for your business in the past. When you apply for a solo 401k, you would use your business’ EIN. However, some sole proprietorships don’t have an EIN and just operate their business using their Social Security Number. While it’s possible to use your SSN rather than an EIN to open a solo 401k, it could complicate things because a solo 401k is an employer-sponsored retirement plan. Having an EIN allows the IRS to be able to identify your business separately from your personal account.
- A solo 401k needs its own EIN: While you don’t need an EIN to open an account, your solo 401k will need to apply for its **own EIN, separate from your business.** A solo 401k is a retirement trust, which makes it an entity that’s separate from your business. The same way that a business needs an EIN to operate, a solo 401k plan also requires **its own EIN** for tax filings, opening a bank account, and opening a brokerage account. Investments through your solo 401k are owned by the 401k trust, **not by you or your business**. When you sell an asset, the IRS is able to tell that the funds are deferred since it’s owned by your solo 401k trust.
- How do I get an EIN: In the IRS form, instead of selecting a business entity, you would select “View Additional Types” in the first step. On the next page, you would select “Employer Plan (401K, Money Purchase Plan, etc.)“. When you’re done, the IRS will provide you an EIN specifically for your solo 401k trust. You can use this EIN to open separate bank and brokerage accounts under your solo 401k.

[mysolo401k.net](https://www.mysolo401k.net/solo-401k/ein-number/): EIN Number for Solo 401k Retirement Trust
- This page reviews the EIN application form steps, as shown in the Carry.com site.
- Check off "View Additional Types ..." and click on "continue." Check off “Employer Plan (401K, Money Purchase Plan, etc.),” and click on “continue.” Enter you name, social security number, and check off “I am the owner, trustee ...,” and click on "continue." Enter your home or business address, phone number and click on "continue."
- When we assist you in opening the solo 401(k) bank or brokerage account, the bank or the brokerage firm will ask for the EIN as they will need it for reporting purposes. Since a Solo 401(k) is a qualified retirement plan, it has to be **sponsored by a business entity**. The EIN is **for the solo 401(k), not for your  self-employed business**.

### Sole proprietor EIN or plan EIN to open a new solo 401K?

[mysolo401k.net](https://www.mysolo401k.net/do-i-need-an-ein-for-my-self-employed-business-to-open-a-solo-401k/): Solo 401K - Do I need separate EIN from my business EIN
- The answer is no. This highlights one of the differences between our solo 401k plan and the discount basic solo 401(k) plans offered by the discount brokerages like Fidelity, Schwab, TD Ameritrade, etc. which generally require that a self-employed person provide an EIN for their business to set up solo 401(k). With our plan, there is no requirement to provide an EIN for the self-employed business to open our Solo 401k plan. Instead, as part of the solo 401k establishment process, we obtain an EIN specifically for the plan which meets the IRS expectation. The IRS expectation is that a separate EIN is obtained for the plan.
- Practically, this is important because to the extent that there is any type of income such as interest income reported with respect to a solo 401(k) investment, by having a separate EIN for the solo 401k plan tax reporting is done under the EIN of the Solo 401k so that the IRS understands that that income is growing on a tax-deferred basis inside your 401(k). If the interest income is earned with respect to a bank account opened under the EIN of the Solo 401k such that the 1099-INT is issued under the EIN of the Solo 401k the IRS will understand that this is growing on a tax-deferred basis and not look for the income to be reported on the business or personal tax return of the self-employed individual.

[carry.com](https://carry.com/learn/solo-401k-ein-requirement): The solo 401K EIN requirement
- A solo 401k needs its own EIN. While you don’t need an EIN to open an account, your solo 401k will need to apply for its own EIN, separate from your business.
- A solo 401k is a retirement trust, which makes it an entity that’s separate from your business. The same way that a business needs an EIN to operate, a solo 401k plan also requires its own EIN for tax filings, opening a bank account, and opening a brokerage account. Investments through your solo 401k are owned by the 401k trust, not by you or your business. When you sell an asset, the IRS is able to tell that the funds are deferred since it’s owned by your solo 401k trust.
- The only annual tax filing requirement for a solo 401k is Form 5500-EZ. Any solo 401k plan with assets over $250,000 is required to file one each year. In order to file Form 5500-EZ, you’ll need to provide an EIN. While you could open a solo 401k without an EIN, it’s better to just get one now while you’re in the process of applying so that you don’t have to worry about it later – especially given how easy it is to apply for one.
- For obtaining an EIN for your solo 401k, some plan providers will take care of it for you. If you prefer to do it yourself, the process is the same as when you applied for your business EIN. Instead of selecting a business entity, you would select “View Additional Types” in the first step. On the next page, you would select “Employer Plan (401K, Money Purchase Plan, etc.)“. When you’re done, the IRS will provide you an EIN specifically for your solo 401k trust. You can use this EIN to open separate bank and brokerage accounts under your solo 401k. If you have trouble, ask your plan provider for help.

[irafinancialgroup.com](https://www.irafinancialgroup.com/learn-more/solo-401k/do-i-need-an-ein-for-my-solo-401k): Do I need an EIN for my Solo 401(k)?
- There is no formal requirement that an EIN be acquired for a Solo 401(k) plan since it is an owner-only plan. Many plan sponsors will use the plan participant’s social security number or business EIN as the plan tax identification number. However, any Solo 401(k) plan that wants to establish a bank account will likely need an EIN for the plan.  With IRA Financial, we can establish the plan’s bank account via Capital One without an EIN, however, if you wish to use your own bank, you will need to have IRA Financial acquire an EIN for you.
- Does the Solo 401(k) Plan Trust Need an EIN?: A 401(k) plan is a trust, and under Internal Revenue Code Section 401, plan assets must be held in trust. There is no IRS or Department of Labor requirement that a separate trust be created in connection with the establishment of the plan. As a result, a separate trust is often not established as per the plan documents. This is the reason why, in such a case, no separate trust agreement is required to be included in the plan documents, and it is also why a separate EIN is not required to be acquired for the plan trust. Typically, an EIN would only be acquired for the plan itself. Most Solo 401(k) plans will acquire an EIN for the plan for purposes of opening a bank or brokerage account.

### Using SSN and EIN for tax filing as sole proprietorship

[bogleheads.org](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=407992): Solo 401k -- SSN vs. EIN
- I would like to open a Solo 401k account with Schwab, but they're both requiring that I submit an EIN in order to create the account. I've heard that I can generate an EIN on the IRS website, and submit it as part of my Solo 401k application. Question: Would it be OK if my 1099 is still being sent to my SSN (and NOT the EIN), but the Solo 401k is opened with the EIN?
- Yes, that's fine. When you get the EIN online there is a place to **select that it's an EIN for a qualified plan. That's what you want.** The plan EIN does not need to be the same as your employer EIN (if you decide to get one at some point). You'll need an EIN for the plan so that you can file 5500-EZ someday, you can't use your SSN on that form.
- 5500 EZ requires the employer EIN, not the plan EIN.
- Question: When the time comes for me to file a 5500 EZ, what EIN would I use? I won't have an "employer" EIN and per the guidance above, I'll just have a "plan" EIN ... You need to register for a sole proprietorship EIN. It takes two minutes on the IRS site ... If I register for the sole proprietorship EIN, but continue to receive 1099's for my SSN, will that be an issue? Answer: No.
- In Post #4, MP123 was suggesting that I get an EIN for the plan and submit that to Schwab (and *not* an EIN for the sole prop). And then, if/when my 401k balance exceeds 250k and I have to file a 5500 EZ, I'll then get an EIN for the sole prop and use it for that form.
- Another comment: I don't think Schwab ever asks for a plan EIN. Only employer. Here's their adoption agreement. It asks for "Adopting Employer's Federal Tax Identification Number." I don't see anywhere to put a plan EIN. My wife has a solo 401(k) with them. I don't think she even knows or has a plan EIN ... The "Trust identification number" is the EIN for the plan in the adoption agreement you link above. But I believe you are correct that the employer EIN is used on 5500-EZ rather than the plan EIN as I first said.
- A part of me is still worried that if the 1099's are going direct to my SSN, the Sole Prop EIN isn't generating any income. Does anyone know whether that'll cause complications wrt my ability to make employee and/or employer contributions into the Solo 401k? Answers: Shouldn't matter.

[bogleheads.org](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=341358): Are there specific sections in our tax filings where I need to use EIN instead of SSN?
- When you fill out Schedule C, **your name and social security number (just yours, NOT your spouse's) goes on the top of the form.** Then your business name is entered in Box C and your EIN is entered in box D.
- Edit: if you happen to have separate businesses with different EINs, or if your wife had her own self employment income, each business gets their own Schedule C form. With the same personal information on the very top line and then the individual business is referenced on the rest of the form.

Does it matter for my taxes whether I open self-employment retirement account using SSN (or) EIN? Does IRS treat my SSN & EIN as same entity?
- You can't file a 5500-EZ form for the i401k using a SSN, you must use an EIN. And you'll eventually have to file a 5500-EZ when you close the plan or sooner if assets are over $250k. So you might as well use an EIN for the i401k from the beginning, even if you might be able to open it under your SSN.
- I believe you can use the business EIN for the i401k or you can get the plan it's own EIN, there's a special selection for that on the IRS EIN site.

Let's say I setup two businesses and get two different EINs.
- If we open two different Solo-401Ks each for the business. For now lets say I don't wanted to group or merge the plans. Each business has its own income generated. Can I contribute to its own respective solo-401K plans based on their respective business incomes ? Example: Business A - EIN -1 - Solo-401K - contribution based on Business A income, with a max limit of 56K (based on IRS limits). Business B - EIN -2 - Solo-401K - contribution based on Business B income, with a max limit of 56K (based on IRS limits). Now both business COMBINED I cannot put more than 56K ? (or) each business can put max of 56K to their respective solo-401k (56K+56K)?
- If you control both A and B then you can contribute $56k total. But, for example, if you work a regular job (that you don't control) with a 401k you can make a full contribution there. And then also make the employER contribution to a i401k in a business that you do control. That's because the employER contribution is an expense of the business. But you can only make one employEE deferral total no matter how many businesses (controlled or not).
- A 401k or solo 401k contribution has two parts: the employER contribution, and the employEE deferral. The employee deferral can be a max of $19.5k (plus $6k of you're over 50), no matter how many businesses, whether you own them or not. The employer contribution can be up to 25% of your wages from a business, and all the businesses that you own are one business. The total of both can't be more than $56k for one business. Each additional business can also contribute 25% of your wages as an employer contribution. So if you work at MegaCorp and max out your $56k contribution there you can also contribute 25% of your wages (up to $56k) from any side businesses you own. But all of your side businesses are treated as one.

### EIN for estimated tax payments on ES-1040

[turbotax.com](https://ttlc.intuit.com/community/business-taxes/discussion/ein-vs-ssn/00/846902): EIN vs SSN

[ttlc.intuit.com](https://ttlc.intuit.com/community/business-taxes/discussion/when-to-use-ein-or-ssn-for-single-member-llc/00/323244): When to use EIN or SSN for single member LLC?
- I registered the business as an single member LLC a year ago and requested an EIN a few months ago. I just submitted 2016 taxes using only my SSN, filing under a 1040 on the Schedule C, and did not include the EIN on there. The main reason I got the EIN was so that when I receive various 1099s the individuals and companies do not have my SSN. I must now submit quarterly tax payments which, since I filed under my SSN for 2016, shows that I must file quarterly with the SSN and cannot use the EIN. Should I forget about the EIN entirely, as the only point was to use it when individuals request a W9? Or can I still use it for that as it is connected to my SSN.
- You will use your SSN since this is a disregarded entity. This applies to your quarterly estimated tax payments as well. However, you can use **either your SSN or EIN when receiving 1099-MISC income**. Just make sure to **report all these 1099-MISCs under your Schedule C** since they all relate to your LLC business income.
- Also you can use your EIN for your LLC when necessary like if purchasing property for your LLC or filing your Sales tax report with your state's Department of Revenue.
- Remember, *ONLY* the IRS issues EINs. When you requested the EIN you had to provide an SSN for the IRS to tie that EIN to. So it *does* *not* *matter* which you use when dealing with the IRS. THe IRS *knows* what SSN the EIN belogs to, and you and the IRS are the only ones who need to know what SSN your EIN is tied to.
- Iit's not a "MUST" that you file with your SSN either. You can use either. I've had some quarters where I'ved filed with the SSN, and other quarters with the EIN. It *does* *not* *matter* and is not a problem or issue for the IRS.
- Potentially confusing info from IRS forms: _For federal income tax purposes, a single-member LLC classified as a disregarded entity generally must use the owner's social security number (SSN) or employer identification number (EIN) for all information returns and reporting related to income tax. For example, if a disregarded entity LLC that is owned by an individual is required to provide a Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and Certification, the W-9 should provide the owner’s SSN or EIN, not the LLC’s EIN._
- Response: The reason that a Single Member LLC (SMLLC) is required to use the SSN of the owner is because of backup withholding.  If the legal name and Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) that the IRS expects to be associated with the reporting do not match their database, a red flag will go up.  Think of the W-9 form as a map. The W-9 ties into the 1099-MISC because that is the form that reports amounts paid to an independent contractor. SMLLCs are considered disregarded entities separate from their owners, as you know. This is because **the IRS expects the taxpayer to carry the income onto his or her personal tax return**.  For this purpose, it's irrelevant whether the LLC uses its own EIN for banking.  Imagine you are going to the airport to catch a flight.  It doesn't matter if you are representing your business or if it's a personal vacation- you need to show your driver's license and not your Articles of Organization to get on the plane.
- Form W-9 asks for the Name as shown on your tax return on line one, and the Business Name / Disregarded Entity name on line two.  Line two makes it clear to the IRS that there is another EIN out there being used in banks, for example.  If the disregarded LLC's EIN is used on Form W-9 line one and on Form 1099-MISC, then nothing will happen to you when you file your tax return; however, the IRS could potentially inform the withholding agent that they are required to collect a B Notice from you to correct the information.
- When filling out a W-9 (to receive 1099s), you use the EIN (or SSN) that is in YOUR name, not the name of the LLC ... Yes, you can report the 1099 on the Schedule C for the LLC.  The IRS looks for the business owner's SSN or EIN when receiving a 1099 form.  However, the IRS is matching income to the return.  If you choose to use the LLC's EIN, you may receive a follow-up from the IRS requesting information to ensure the income was reported properly.

### Solo 401K and IRA contribution limits

[irs.gov](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-401k-and-profit-sharing-plan-contribution-limits): Two annual limits apply to contributions:
- A limit on employee elective salary deferrals. Salary deferrals are contributions an employee makes, in lieu of salary, to certain retirement plans: 401(k) plans, 403(b) plans, SARSEP IRA plans (Salary Reduction Simplified Employee Pension Plans), SIMPLE IRA plans (Savings Incentive Match Plans for Employees)
- An overall limit on contributions to a participant’s account. The limit applies to the total of: elective deferrals (but not catch-up contributions), employer matching contributions, employer nonelective contributions, allocations of forfeitures
- The limit on employee elective deferrals (for traditional and safe harbor plans) is: $23,000 

Total annual contributions (annual additions) to all of your accounts in plans maintained by one employer (and any related employer) are limited.
- The annual additions paid to a participant’s account cannot exceed the lesser of: 100% of the participant's compensation, or $69,000 ($76,500 including catch-up contributions) for 2024
- an employer’s deduction for contributions to a defined contribution plan (profit-sharing plan or money purchase pension plan) cannot be more than 25% of the compensation paid (or accrued) during the year to eligible employees participating in the plan

Example 1: In 2020, Greg, 46, is employed by an employer with a 401(k) plan, and he also works as an independent contractor for an unrelated business and sets up a solo 401(k). Greg contributes the maximum amount to his employer’s 401(k) plan for 2020, $19,500. He would also like to contribute the maximum amount to his solo 401(k) plan. 
- He is not able to make further elective deferrals to his solo 401(k) plan because he has already contributed his personal maximum, $19,500. He would also like to contribute the maximum amount to his solo 401(k) plan.
- Greg is not able to make further elective salary deferrals to his solo 401(k) plan because he has already contributed his personal maximum, $19,500, to his employer’s plan. However, he has enough earned income from his business to contribute the overall maximum for the year, $57,000. Greg can make a **nonelective contribution** of $57,000 to his solo 401(k) plan. This $57,000 limit is not reduced by the elective deferrals Greg made under his employer’s plan because the limit on annual additions applies to each plan separately.

Example 2:  In Example 1, if Greg were 52 years old and eligible to make catch-up contributions, he could contribute an additional $6,500 of elective deferrals for 2020. 
- His catch-up contribution could be split between the plans in any proportion he chooses. Or, Greg may contribute the full $6,500 catch-up contribution to his solo 401(k) plan, making a total contribution of $63,500 for 2020.
- This is because, although he made nonelective contribution to his solo 401(k) plan up to the maximum of $57,000, the $57,000 limit is not reduced by the elective deferral catch-up contributions.

### Classifying contributions as employee vs. employer

[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/etrade/comments/18sdcdd/solo_401k_contribution/): Solo 401k contribution
- The plan administrator is responsible for creating the tax documentation and filing the tax paperwork and could address this. E-trade doesn’t get involved tax wise with solo 401k accounts. If it was meant for 2022 then you may have to amend your 2022 tax filing.
- The $$ goes into the same account. What matters is what appears on your tax form which E-trade doesn’t have anything to do with. This is the nature of a non-custodial account. Talking to E-trade folks about this is like a deer in the headlights - this isn’t something they know and they cannot provide any guidance / take any actions.
- Plan administrator, which is usually you yourself, reports the contributions both employee and employer for the year. E-trade told me they dont really report contributions to IRS and its handled by plan administrator. For employee contributions, you got to tell E-trade to reclassify it as employee contributions unless sending a paper check with a deposit slip where you can say its employee contribution. Online transfer and have them reclassify before end of year.

[bogleheads.com](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=380410): E*Trade Solo 401k - Employee vs Employer Contributions
- It does not matter how E-Trade classifies plan contributions (i.e., as Employ/EE and/or Employ/ER). E-Trade does not report the contribution classification to the IRS. You (and not E-Trade) are the Solo 401k Plan Administrator. You as Plan Administrator are responsible for, among other things, calculating allowable E/EE and E/ER contributions. If the plan assets at December 31 are $250k+, you are required to file a Form 5500-EZ which does require breakout of Plan contributions between E/EE and E/ER.

### Tax savings from Solo 401K contributions

[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/111gkcz/please_help_me_to_understand_the_tax_benefit_of/): Please help me to understand the tax benefit of the Solo 401(k)
- Question: Of the remaining $97,100 that is in the bank, I (in my capacity as an employee of my own single-member LLC) can contribute $15,500 (I contribute $7,000 to my W-2 401k, hitting the $22,500 contribution limit). This leaves $81,600 as my business income for this calculation. The LLC (as the employer) can contribute the amount that is equal to 20% of my net business income, or 20% of $81,600, or $16,320. This leaves $65,280. Assuming this is all correct, does this mean that my Schedule C income is reduced all the way down to $65,280, or am I thinking about this wrong? ... I'm still having trouble figuring out exactly how the contribution helps me. If I contribute the max as an employee (e.g. $15,500) and then the max as an employer (e.g. let's just say $20,000), how does this effect my taxable income?
- Answers: Your own retirement contributions from self-employment don't directly reduce your "Schedule C" income, because that would also reduce your self-employment tax. Instead, the retirement contributions are taken as a deduction on Schedule 1. For the exact specifics of how much you can contribute, there is a worksheet available in Publication 560, Chapter 5, Page 22 (irs.gov/Pub560).
- It [the contribution] increases the value on Schedule 1, line 16 [of the deduction], which increases the value on Form 1040 line 10, which results in a lower AGI [due to higher deduction] and thus lower income tax.
- ... You are correct in that the Salary Reduction/Roth Elective deferral limit is an aggregate total of the contributions you make between the two 401k plans, and the combined total cannot exceed $22,500. The Employer discretionary contribution c an be up to 25% of your adjusted net income, which is basically the net income on the Schedule C after the employer portion of the self-employment taxes have been paid.

[irs.gov](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/self-employed-individuals-calculating-your-own-retirement-plan-contribution-and-deduction): Calculating your own retirement plan contribution and deduction
- If you are self-employed (a sole proprietor or a working partner in a partnership or limited liability company), you must use a special rule to calculate retirement plan contributions for yourself.
- You calculate self-employment (SE) tax using the amount of your net earnings from self-employment and following the instructions on Schedule SE, Self-Employment Tax. However, you must make adjustments to your net earnings from self-employment to arrive at the amount of "plan compensation" to use to determine the plan contribution/deduction for yourself.
- Total limits on plan contributions depend in part on your plan type. See the contribution limits for your plan.

### Changing business type on solo 401K

[bogleheads.org](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=390878): Changing solo 401(k) from LLC to sole proprietorship
- "My wife has an LLC sponsoring her solo 401(k). She decided this year to shut down her business and go back to work. We would like to amend the adoption agreement to "move" the plan to her sole proprietorship. The adoption agreement paperwork has you fill in the sponsoring employer information on it, but i don't see how they tie the plan to the prior plan with a different name and EIN."
- Answers: do not set up a new 401(k). You want to either (1) amend the current plan or (2) transfer the current plan.
- Normally you can add the sole proprietorship in the controlled group section of the amended plan document. But since the Sponsor (LLC) is being terminated, the paperwork in your case is likely different. If the EIN used for the Solo 401k Plan is the LLC’s (sponsor’s) EIN, your spouse will need to obtain a new EIN for the Plan. Form 5500-EZ Part II Lines 4a-4d are used to report any changes to the Plan Sponsor Name/Plan Name/EIN since the last Form 5500-EZ filed, if any.

[bogleheads.org](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=438455): Solo 401(k), moving from LLC to Sole Proprietor, change employer of existing plan?
- You can change the sponsoring employer. My wife did that when she closed her LLC and went back to a salary job. She has been filing 5500s due to the balance, and there is a place on the form to indicate that the employer changed. She has continued to file as a sole proprietor. Haven't heard a complaint from the feds.

- Question: What if I want to close the original LLC that I used to set up the solo 401(k)? If I start a new LLC this year, can I roll over the old solo 401(k) into a new solo 401(k) yet to be created? Can you help with this?
- For example, a self-employed person may operate their self-employed business through one LLC and now they wish to operate their business through a new LLC. In this scenario, the plan documents will be amended to reflect the new entity as opposed to shutting down one solo 401(k) and then starting up a new solo 401(k). Taking this approach means that there are no changes to the Solo 401k investments, accounts, etc. as it is merely a change at the document level.

### Other Questions

Is a solo 401k considered a separate capacity for SIPC?
- Yes, a solo 401k is considered a separate capacity for SIPC protection, meaning that if you have a regular brokerage account and a solo 401k at the same brokerage, each account would be insured up to the $500,000 limit, as long as the brokerage is a SIPC member; essentially treating them as distinct accounts with separate coverage.
- SIPC considers different types of accounts held by a single individual at the same brokerage as separate capacities, allowing each account to be insured up to the maximum limit.
- If you have multiple individual accounts at the same brokerage, they are not considered separate capacities and are combined for coverage purposes.
