### Cross-asset carry as the slope of yield curve

[macrosynergy.com blog](https://macrosynergy.com/research/cross-asset-carry-an-introduction/#cross-asset-carry:-an-introduction): Cross-asset carry
- Carry can be defined as return for unchanged market prices and is easy to calculate in real time across assets. Carry strategies often reap risk premia and implicit subsidies. Historically, they have produced positive returns in FX, commodities, bonds and equity. Carry strategies can also be combined across asset classes to render diversification benefits. Historically, since 1990, the performance of such diversified carry portfolios has been strong, with Sharpe ratios close to 1, limited correlation to benchmark indices and less of a downside skew that FX carry trades.
- 'Carry' is the return that an investor enjoys if all market conditions, including the asset’s price, **remain the same**. It measures the value appreciation that accrues to the owner of an asset if there is **no expected or unexpected** price change: total return is the sum of carry, expected price appreciation and unexpected price shock.

Allocation based on behavior of futures markets
- Assets that exhibit a term structure of futures in **backwardation** [downward sloped futures price curve] should generate a **positive roll yield** and therefore a **positive excess return** when market conditions remain unchanged. These assets should therefore be generally **over-weighted** in a carry portfolio.
- Assets that exhibit a term structure of futures in **contango** [upward sloped futures price curve] should generate a **negative roll yield** and therefore a **negative excess return** when market conditions remain unchanged. These assets should therefore be generally **under-weighted** in a carry portfolio.”
- When the market conditions remain unchanged, the term structure does not move at all and therefore the entirety of asset return is the **roll yield**. Evidently, carry is just the **slope of the futures curve**."

### Enhancing returns with futures carry strategies

[investresolve.com blog](https://investresolve.com/enhancing-portfolio-returns-with-futures-carry-strategies/): Carry can be loosely defined as the expected return of an investment assuming no change in its price. More thoroughly, carry is the economic benefit that one might expect to accrue by holding – or “carrying” – a particular investment, minus the costs associated with holding it.
- "Over the past three decades, hypothetical optimized futures carry strategies have demonstrated attractive risk-adjusted returns with low average correlations to core holdings of stocks and bonds."
- Futures contracts enable investors to buy or sell a ‘spot’ asset on a future date at a predetermined price. The futures term structure describes the relationship between prices of contracts expiring at different dates. In ‘contango’, distant futures prices are higher than near-term futures, implying negative expected yield as prices converge to spot over time. Conversely, ‘backwardation’ occurs when distant futures prices are lower, implying positive expected yield.
- Forms of carry across asset classes: While carry represents the economic benefit of holding an asset minus the associated costs (Koijen et al. 2018), it manifests uniquely in each asset class.
  - In equities, carry is the expected dividend yield minus the cost of financing.
  - For bonds, it is the coupon and roll yield minus financing costs.
  - Commodities have convenience yields offset by storage, transportation, and financing costs, while currency carry is the interest rate differential between the local and foreign currency
- Global carry strategies typically allow markets to compete against all other markets in the investment universe rather than isolating competition within sectors. Generally, portfolios that enable all markets to directly compete based on their carry and volatility metrics outperform those constructed from sector-specific strategies, where markets only vie for allocations within their respective sectors.
- Our research found that ensemble approaches combining both methods delivered the strongest results.
  - Figure 5 shows that an ensemble of inverse volatility- and optimization-weighted carry strategies produced a gross Sharpe ratio of 1.09 with a 27.5% maximum drawdown. Their correlations to stocks and bonds oscillated between positive and negative regimes over multi-year periods. This suggests thoughtfully constructed carry strategies have the potential to provide meaningful diversification benefits across changing market environments.
  - Carry strategies delivered consistent positive average hypothetical returns across all benchmark quintiles, largely independent of the severity of stock or bond losses.
  - Carry proved particularly resilient during major stock market crises in our historical analysis, providing valuable “crisis alpha”. As seen in Figure 10 and Figure 11, carry thrived during the Global Financial Crisis and the early 2000s tech crash, while mostly shrugging off the COVID-driven selloff.
