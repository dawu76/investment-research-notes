### Home office depreciation

How was this calculated?

There are two ways your home office expenses could have been calculated, depending on which method you chose, the simplified deduction or actual expenses.

If you chose the simplified method:

The deduction is calculated based on the square footage of your home office.
The current calculation is $5 per square foot of your home office. If your home office is 100 square feet, you’d get a $500 deduction when used as a home office for 12 months.
You're limited to a maximum of 300 square feet of office space per business owner. Your office space may be bigger than that, but the deduction is based on no more than 300 square feet.
The simplified home office deduction can’t exceed $1,500.
If you chose the actual method:

The deduction is calculated using the actual expenses you had for your home office, like utilities, rent, property taxes, depreciation of the home, and carryover losses.
You have to have records and receipts of your home office expenses.
Any home office expenses that were unallowed in a prior year can be taken when you choose the actual method.

### Health insurance

> If you reported self-employment income on any of the schedules listed below and you used that income to buy health insurance through Healthcare.gov or your state Marketplace, you can deduct your premiums on your taxes. However, you need to tie that income to your 1095-A so we can properly calculate the deduction amount.

Schedule C — Self-employed business income
Schedule F—Farm income
Schedule K-1 partnership—This only counts if you earned self-employment income from that partnership, which means you'd have an entry on Line 14 of your K-1 from that partnership.
Schedule K-1 S corporation —This only counts if you have a W-2 from that S corporation and are an owner with more than 2% interest in the S corporation.

- "all your business income, 1/2 self-employment tax, contributions to retirement plans, and health insurance is itemized separately on Schedule 1 rather than just reporting your total net income amount in line 3 Schedule 1. This is the way the IRS categorizes this type of reporting ..."
- clarification: "employer contributions to a solo 401(k) are not deductible on Schedule C.  They only go on Schedule 1 line 16 as part of the self-employed retirement deduction, which you indicated.  Only employer contributions for non-owner employees are deductible on Schedule C, and a solo 401(k) is not permitted to have non-owner participants .... it is an adjustment to income on Schedule 1 line 16 which goes to 1040 line 10. That is for both the [employ-] EE & ER contributions.  No, it is not new."
- '... This has never changed.  The sole proprietor gets the deduction on Schedule 1 line 16 for both the employee elective deferrals and the employer contribution to the sole proprietor's 401(k) account. See the [IRS instructions](https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1040sc#en_US_2024_publink24329wd0e1604) for Schedule C line 19 ... If you file Schedule C, you are a sole proprietor. A single member LLC that has not made the election to be a corporation is a sole proprietorship. View on TurboTax's Keogh, SEP and SIMPLE Contribution Worksheet the calculation of your permissible solo 401(k) contribution."

### Q&A

**Question**: suppose someone owes $10,000 in self-employment taxes to the IRS. is it possible for someone to have to pay that self-employment tax while at the same time be eligible for a refund on income tax through other credits / deductions?

Response from Claude 3.7 Sonnet

> Yes, this is absolutely possible. Self-employment taxes and income taxes are calculated separately on your tax return, and it's entirely possible to owe money for one while receiving a refund for the other.
Here's how this can happen:

Separate calculations: Self-employment tax (15.3% covering Social Security and Medicare) is calculated on Schedule SE based on your net self-employment earnings, regardless of other deductions or credits.
Income tax calculation: Your income tax is calculated separately after accounting for all deductions and credits, which could include:

Business expense deductions
Retirement contributions (IRA, Solo 401(k))
Standard or itemized deductions
Child tax credits
Education credits
Earned Income Tax Credit
Stimulus credits

Final tax bill: When you file your return, these calculations are combined:

If your withholdings/estimated tax payments exceed your total tax liability (self-employment tax + income tax - credits), you get a refund
If they're less, you owe the difference

For example, someone might have:
$10,000 in self-employment tax
$3,000 in income tax before credits
$5,000 in refundable tax credits
$9,000 in withholdings/estimated payments

Final calculation: $10,000 + $3,000 - $5,000 = $8,000 total tax due
With $9,000 already paid, they would receive a $1,000 refund despite owing self-employment tax.
This scenario is particularly common for self-employed people with children who qualify for refundable credits like the Child Tax Credit or Earned Income Credit.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.

**Question**: if i am self-employed, do my contributions to my personal IRA as well as solo 401K accounts reduce my tax bill for the year?

Response from Claude 3.7 Sonnet

> Yes, if you're self-employed, contributions to both a personal IRA and a Solo 401(k) can reduce your tax bill for the year, though they affect different parts of your taxes:

Solo 401(k) Contributions:
Employer contributions (as your own employer) reduce your self-employment income, which lowers both your income tax and self-employment tax
Employee contributions (as your own employee) reduce your income tax but not your self-employment tax
For 2024, you can contribute up to $23,000 as an employee, plus an additional $7,500 if you're 50 or older
As an employer, you can contribute up to 25% of your net self-employment income

Traditional IRA Contributions:
Reduce your income tax but not your self-employment tax
For 2024, you can contribute up to $7,000 ($8,000 if you're 50 or older)
Deductibility may be limited if you or your spouse have a retirement plan at work and your income exceeds certain thresholds

Important Notes:
You can contribute to both a Solo 401(k) and an IRA in the same year
The tax benefits apply to traditional accounts, not Roth versions (which provide tax-free growth instead of immediate tax deductions)
There are specific timing requirements for establishing and funding these accounts to count for the current tax year

These retirement contributions can significantly reduce your overall tax bill while simultaneously building your retirement savings.
