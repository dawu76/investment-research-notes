#### Risk Premia Harvesting

Uncertain payoffs and expected returns
- Two games may have the same expected return, but if Game 1 has a certain payoff while Game 2 has an uncertain payoff (e.g. lose $100 with 50% probability and win $300 with 50% probability), then Game 1 is preferable.
- If Game 2's expected return is higher than Game 1's, then it may be preferable. It depends on whether we can take advantage of the edge, e.g. we can play the game many times with small enough bets to avoid total ruin.
- Let's think in terms of risky assets instead of games. What if you had one asset that guaranteed a certain return and another asset with the same expected return but with an uncertain payoff (e.g. a chance of losing 50% or gaining 100%)? In that case, no one would want to purchase the risky asset when they could earn the same expected return with zero risk.
- But then without any buyers, the price of the second asset would drop until the asset's supply and demand roughly equalize. After this price drop, its expected return might exceed that of the risk-free asset.
- This is what happens with financial assets, e.g. risk-free T-bills earning 2% versus risky stocks with uncertain payoffs. Or stable blue-chip dividend-paying companies versus early stage growth companies. The prices of the riskier assets should be low enough so that their expected return exceeds that of the risk-free asset.

Assets are bundles of risk
- Assets that are exposed to more risks are less attractive, causing them to trade at lower prices. These lower prices enable these riskier assets to have higher expected returns.
- Bonds, even T-bills, are not risk-free, as they are subject to the risk of inflation and rising interest rates. Equities are exposed to additional risks, e.g. lack of liquidity, political risk, slowing economic growth, poor governance. 
- When interest rates rise, bonds with a given yield become less attractive. This reduces the number of buyers of that bond, causing its price to fall. After this price drop, the bond's yield increases, making it relatively more attractive again. But this price drop hurts the current holders of the bond. They can choose to hold the bond to maturity, in which case they likely won't suffer an actual loss on their bond position. But the value of the bond's coupon payments is now less attractive relative to other alternatives. Inflation is another risk to bonds, as rising inflation makes the coupons less valuable.
- Due to their additional risks, equities may suffer steeper price drops. At the same time, due to their pricing in these risks, they have enjoyed much higher returns on a long-term basis than bonds. This is an example of *risk premia*, i.e. an additional premium earned for taking on those risks.
- We want to expose ourselves to additional risks only when we will earn excess returns that will compensate us for that added risk. We want to minimize our exposure to risks that we aren't rewarded for. Examples of risks that we may not be compensated for: risk from high volatility, risk from highly concetrated positions.
