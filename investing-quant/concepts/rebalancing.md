### Rebalancing

#### Optimal times to rebalance

"More frequent rebalancing will on average have little impact on risk reduction, even less benefit from a return perspective, and just racks up unnecessary transaction costs along the way ... The research suggests a superior rebalancing methodology is to allow portfolio allocations to drift slightly, and trigger a rebalancing trade **only if a target threshold is reached**. If the investments grow in line and the relative weightings don’t change, no rebalancing trade occurs. However, if these “rebalancing tolerance bands” are breached, the investment – and only the investment – that crosses the line, is then bought or sold to bring it back within the bands."

Rebalancing presents the opportunity to generate better returns – particularly when rebalancing amongst investments with similar long-term return potential – as the process of selling what has become overweight and buying is underweight can indirectly help investors to systematically sell high and buy low. In essence, the goal is to find investments that have moved to extremes, and trigger a rebalancing trade that buys/sell the investment just before it “snaps back” and reverts towards its long-term average.

What happens if we rebalance too frequently (e.g. monthly)?
- For a position that's doing well, you can end up selling portions of a position while it still has room to run.
- For a position about to decline in a year-long crash, you can end up buying more shares that experience the subsequent decline as the investment continues its path downwards.

In the short-to-intermediate term, an investment can have significant relative outperformance or underperformance extending for months or even years at a time. Rebalancing too frequently curtails the positive momentum and adds too quickly into the negative.
